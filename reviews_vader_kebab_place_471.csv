0,"Mediterranean food is my absolute favorite, so when I came across this place in Santa Ana, I had to give it a try. Walking in, there was a really nice ambiance. Everything is very clean, there are pictures on the wall in case you're not sure what to get, and the staff is super friendly. Looks like it was remodeled. Fits that modern vibe! Portion sizes are huge for the price, so that's a definite plus for me. More bank for your buck, am I right? As someone with a small stomach, I couldn't finish the entire meal, so I took it home for the next day. Still just as good. ÌâåÊI got the plate with lamb kebab. So good! Will be coming back to try their chicken kebab plate. They also have a Yelp Check-In offer, so don't forget about that ;)",0.9828,0.216,0.771,0.013
1,"Just got my predictable angry reply by the owner. I'll keep it short. It's pretty telling that the owner says things like ""I'm sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review"". Implying that I'm in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it's ""pretend false"" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn't happen and I didn't come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.I'm sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. The rest of what you're saying, I'll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of ""Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn't be allowed to review!"". That's not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. I don't really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.Of course there is deception, if you're saying ""Salad or rice"" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying ""Fries ok with the wrap?"", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren't going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It's smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it's taxes and such), they don't find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.Yes, it's worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you ""You don't have normal water outside of these bottles?"" to which you replied ""No, sorry"". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?I'll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it's pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using 'cost-effective' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I'll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.I note you said the reason that you didn't offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I'll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don't like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner's responses to other negative responses. ÌâåÊAll are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don't enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don't talk about your experience if you didn't pay in your party, it doesn't count apparently!Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.",0.9708,0.129,0.763,0.109
2,"Came here for the first time today for lunch!!!!Definitely not disappointed, the food is super fresh and portions are outrageous.

3,"Wow! What a gem this turned out to be! Was in town for business yesterday and grabbed some lunch here. Went with the chicken kebab plate which came with 1/2 rice 1/2 salad, grilled veggies and a side of pita bread. I particularly liked their mint sauce which came with the bread - nice touch vs. the usual hummus you get in other places. Food takes about 15 mins to cook but the meat is so tender and fresh...worth the wait!",0.6152,0.088,0.886,0.027
4,"Found this place just from walking around in the area and I'm so glad I took a chance because WOW! I ordered the Salmon Kebab and it was delicious! Sometimes I need more lemon to give salmon more flavor but this one didn't need it. I asked for half & half of their Greek salad and rice for my sides and it was perfect. They also brought out slices of pita bread with a tasty green sauce as our starter. It was so good, that we ordered some to-go. Definitely coming back!",0.9594,0.226,0.731,0.044
5,Omg can I just say to die for! Ordered via Postmates for the first time and I must say that you for sure get what you paid for. The chicken is extra tender and not burned at all like other places.

9,"So so good. We got the Sultan Platter and the Gyro Kebab , every single bite was delicious. We overshot how much food we should order but don't mind having leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. It came out to about 63 dollars for our meal but It's so so worth it. Every single bite was so fresh and tasty. We'll probably just stick to ordering the Sultan platter for the two of us to share next time. But again, so worth it. You won't regret it.",0.9678,0.221,0.779,0.0
10,"Service was good, food is great. I ordered the Sultan platter which came with three kebabs: chicken, ground sirloin, and my choice of lamb. All meats were good and flavorful. The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.",0.9725,0.191,0.762,0.047

13,"Downtown Santa Ana has no shortage destinations to eat. Luckily I work super duper close and this was one of the first places I checked out. Specializing in fresh made to order kebabs, salads, wraps. This place deserves a gold star. Located on 4th street in the hope you find parking zone. Bring those quarters for the meter. Or call in your order and park in the structure and take advantage of their 20 minute validation.The chicken Kebab plate is off the hook. Served with rice, salad and warm pita bread. Paired with garlic sauce and a green sauce. Chicken is super moist and flavorful. In fact, I couldnt help myself and busted open my box on my way home and grabbed a bite. It was so good. House made salad dressing was one of the best I've had.Service is friendly. The owner takes great pride in his food. Yelp check in scores you one free appetizer and drink.Can't wait to return.",0.9852,0.217,0.732,0.052
14,"Came here based off yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint, everything was wonderful!!! I'm so full right now shared the Sultan platter with my wife and we also had the sampler appetizer. The humus - tzatziki - babaganoush were all outstanding along with their cilantro citrus dip = Great combination. On the platter we had Chicken, Steak, Lamb kabobs all three were cooked perfect and the flavor was the best I've had.(Did I mention I'm stuffed!!) oh yeah and falafel was on point! Without a doubt top Mediterranean place I've been too, don't live near hear but I will definitely be making the 1/2 hour trek to eat here again.

17,"If you don't eat a lot of Lebanese/Persian food, then the food seems good, but bad Persian food is still good. Compared to most places, the food is only okay. The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant. Free water please.Waitress was sweet but owner seems like a prick outside of his superficial politeness. Just weird unfriendly vibe that I don't encounter too often in restaurants.",0.8735,0.177,0.722,0.101
18,"If you are looking for mediocre Mediterranean, then don't come here! This place is fantastic!!! Fresh, flavorful, locally sourced meats and veggies and house made sauces. As a family we eat low carb / Keto, so we are meat and veggie connoisseurs. The salmon, chicken, steak, gyro and hamburgers were all top notch! The portions are huge. The establishment was clean and tastefully decorated and the food was presented beautifully. We are visiting from out of state and have eaten at a couple of fine dining establishments that couldn't compare with the food we ate here. The owner / manager was so nice and accommodating. Seriously, do yourself a favor and enjoy a meal here. I really wish Kebab Place was back in my home state.",0.98,0.225,0.748,0.027

20,"The food is great. The owner is rude and it's VERY clear that he's cheap. Which is why I'm giving two stars. I ate here a few times and the last time I went, the owner made a big deal over the tiniest CUBE of baklava that I asked for since you get one for free when you check in. He snarked ""you have to eat here! That's the whole point."" Um ok? It was disgusting anyway. I decided not to come back. I will not support businesses that have terrible service. Especially when your food is pricey. I've read so many similar reviews like mine, so none of this comes as a shock. & of course the owner angrily responds over what ? The free baklava ÌâåÊof course that would be the only thing he got from this review. You have TERRIBLE customer service and need to humble yourself. People are spending a lot of money on your food. How petty is it to get upset over a cube of baklava. How about a ""hey thank you for ordering from us, here you go."" How about a ""we have some tables open if you would like to stay and dine in."" I wasn't exploiting any offer. Because I STAYED and ate at the tables outside. But you were so quick to jump down my throat because I ordered online. I planned on eating there. WORK ON YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS! They're lacking immensely!",0.5356,0.084,0.845,0.07
21,Now that this location was shut down for a Rodent infestation I will no longer be coming to this location. I don't understand how a restaurant could allow themselves to get that disgusting. Don't you disinfect and sanitize the entire kitchen? Obviously not if the city has to come shut the establishment down because of such unhealthy working environment. Unfortunately the owner of the company the more mature lady was always rude and angry when approached. I try to make an order and she gave me a look of disgust. Make she wonder if you really value this restaurant or not. If I was a restaurant business owner I would take customer service 100% to the next level.

35,"Agree with Daniel Z.'s review revealing that they are *very* deceitful. It just gives me a bad feeling about the ownership and I prefer to support businesses that are ethical, honest, and customer-oriented rather than ones that engage in tactics to be sneaky about nickel-and-diming or price gouging customers. Makes me wonder what shortcuts they are taking with food/ingredients to penny pinch. I ordered a gyro wrap, and it came complete with surprise extra charges for offered sauces and fries which were pictured on the menu *with* the wrap and the listed price for a wrap; and, when I ordered, he simply said, ""fries ok for the wrap?"" instead of asking me, ""Do you want to add fries for $4"" or whatever. He also offered me the choice of a sauce from a list of I believe 3, never letting me know that it'd be another couple of extra dollars if I made a selection lol. Ended up doubling what I thought I was paying for a quick lunch, and I didn't really enjoy the meal itself. Beware guys--I won't be back.",0.834,0.127,0.803,0.07

39,"Food was delicious. I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming.

It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place.

You can taste the freshness of the salmon in every single bite, not frozen for sure I know my salmon pretty well, it has such a delicious and delicate taste, the spices on it really compliments the entire dish. Now onto the chicken, it's always super moist and delicious, definitely recommend the chicken kebab plate along with the basmati rice and their delicious salad. Last but not least the PITA bread!!!!

This place has the best Mediterranean Food in Orange County hands down. The owner is very hands on and explains the ingredients in each dish that is served.

54,"Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up!

The chicken kabob was moist and delicious with the right seasoning. The rice was simple, yet tasty. And the salad was served with some sort of balsamic dressing and it was good.

He also took time to review the items when he dropped it off and chatted with us for a bit. Their house made cilantro dip is to die for! We ordered the Sultan platter which had 3 skewers and we opted for half rice and half salad and also got their waffle fries.

I get the charges removed later on but I really just wanted some hummus and it kind of puts a damper on my meal. I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat.

75,"Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be. ÌâåÊWould definitely recommend.

86,"Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad.

The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes, ÌâåÊloaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat.

As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience .

156,"Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch. ÌâåÊEverything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable. ÌâåÊSo having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go. ÌâåÊIt took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?). ÌâåÊI took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside. ÌâåÊThe sauces provided were fresh and tasty. ÌâåÊSo I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office. ÌâåÊThe ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line. ÌâåÊI walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap. ÌâåÊI got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops. ÌâåÊI won't make that mistake again. ÌâåÊNot that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious! ÌâåÊChicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. ÌâåÊI could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is.

ÌâåÊSo we walked around the corner and spied Kebab Place, located across the street from Starbucks. ÌâåÊThey advertised their ""highly recommended"" chicken kebab plate for $11.99.The place is tiny and narrow.

ÌâåÊWhile we were eating, the place got filled up pretty fast.The only difference between my chicken plate and Anna's rice only plate is Anna got an extra tomato and no salad, while I got a bowl of salad but heavy on the vinaigrette dressing.

Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant. ÌâåÊFood: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.",-0.1768,0.046,0.914,0.04

Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community.

196,This is the first restaurant I have tried in downtown Santa Ana and was on the ok side. The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.,0.9776,0.181,0.746,0.073

No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp.

Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders.

It has a warm atmosphere and the menu is super easy to read with a lot of good, traditional Arab dishes. Starter:They hit me with some pita bread and their house sauce. It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice. Spot is great. Definitely coming back. The guys here do a top notch job. Supporting small places like this is a must. Try them out.",0.9888,0.242,0.691,0.067
261,"This place is a true diamond in the rough. I've eaten at so many Mediterranean spots in SoCal, and while I love the general flavor of it all, I have not found a ""go to"" restaurant until I stumbled upon Kebab Place. My boyfriend and I ordered the special fillet steak wrap, stoner greek fries, and the combo platter. Every meal comes with complimentary pita bread and a cilantro/jalapeno house sauce (both pita and sauce were pure magick). They also gave us complimentary lentil soup which was very hearty as well as tasty. The fillet mignon in the steak wrap was superior. Marinated, tender, excellent portion. The gyro in the stoner greek fries was perhaps the best gyro I've had. It wasn't dry and was very well seasoned. The hummus, babaganouj, and tzatziki dips were all perfection. Dolmades were delish.I have nothing bad to say about this place. Customer service was great. Food came out quickly, but not too quickly. By the taste of the food, you can tell everything is fresh and dedication and thoughtfulness is flowing through that kitchen. The price, I considered moderate on it's face.

We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price). ÌâåÊI said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation.

345,"I don't know what the deal is with this place. I came by because I was on jury duty and it had good reviews here on Yelp. I was supremely disappointed. I gave two stars rather than one ONLY because the employees were friendly.First of all, the place was nearly empty when I got there (I beat the rush), but it still took over 20 minutes to get my food. A rush came in after I sat down; I can't imagine how long they must have been waiting. I did notice that some takeout orders were going out, so maybe that's what slowed them down. Regardless, when you have a limited time for lunch, a 20 minute wait is not great.Secondly, the food was really weird. I ordered a lamb kebab platter. I got a large oval plate with a HUGE amount of rice (seriously, probably 2X or 3X the amount of rice I'm used to getting at places like this), maybe 4-5oz of meat, two pieces of grilled tomato, one half of a jalapeÌÄå±o, and 4 triangles of pita. Oh, and about a tablespoon of sauce in a small container. The meat tasted reasonably good (maybe a little over-cooked), the pita was ok, and I liked the sauce. But the proportions of everything were way out of whack. I almost laughed when I saw how much rice there was in comparison to vegetables and meat.I almost never complain about pricing on Yelp because I'm happy to pay for good food (and I think people are way too quick to complain that something is ""overpriced""). But this is unreasonable enough that I can't in good conscience let is pass without mention. For the aforementioned plate of mostly rice with a little bit of meat, plus a fountain soda (more on that in a moment), I paid just over $18. Plus tip - there's a tip line on the receipt, and I would have felt like a jerk leaving it blank, so make it $21.Finally, something was really off with the fountain drink. I ordered Diet Coke, and it tasted nothing like Diet Coke. I'm not sure if it was a knockoff brand, or the syrup was expired, or what, but it was NOT Diet Coke. It also had a bit of a ""musty"" taste to it. Maybe just poor quality product, or maybe the equipment wasn't clean? Anyway, I took a few sips and threw it out. I'll also note that the fountain is behind the register, so you can't regulate your own ice/soda ratio or do your own refills (an extremely minor point that wouldn't warrant a mention if it weren't for all the other stuff).Anyway, maybe I came on an off day and ordered the wrong stuff. I don't know what else explains all of the very positive reviews of this place. Believe it or not, I'm a pretty positive person, I like most of the places I eat, and I only leave negative reviews on Yelp if I think it's important. In this case, my experience was bad enough, and the other reviews so out of sync with it, that I feel I HAVE to add some balance.One other probably irrelevant point I should mention. Last time I was on jury duty, about two years ago, I had an eerily similar experience at a different restaurant in this EXACT SAME location. It was a burger place, it had a bunch of really positive reviews, the wait was long, and the food mediocre. Maybe this location is cursed? Maybe I am? I don't know. All I can say is that next time I have jury duty, I will not eat at whatever restaurant happens to be occupying this storefront. There are plenty of other good places to eat near by.",0.9824,0.114,0.81,0.076

I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed.

467,"The Mister and I tried this place for the first time after enjoying a couple of awesome drinks up the street at Proof Bar. It did NOT disappoint! The food was made to perfection. Their hummus is super flavorful and the chicken and salmon kebobs we enjoyed (separately) were outstanding! Everything was fresh, moist and very tasty. The service is also very friendly and the food came out very fast! We are so happy we stumbled upon this place and cannot wait to return!",0.9894,0.336,0.664,0.0
468,"I LUV, LUV, LUV the Kebab Place.  My usual is the salmon kebab (they grill it perfectly), and the chicken kebab is surprisingly moist for chicken breast meat.  A lot of places usually overcook chicken breast and it tends to be dry and hard to swallow, but not at the Kebab Place.  When I have lunch there next week, I'm going to ask the cook if he will grill the lemon wedge they give you on the side.  The staff is very courteous.",0.7422,0.077,0.909,0.014
