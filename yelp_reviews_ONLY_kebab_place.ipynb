      "Mediterranean food is my absolute favorite, so when I came across this place in Santa Ana, I had to give it a try. Walking in, there was a really nice ambiance. Everything is very clean, there are pictures on the wall in case you're not sure what to get, and the staff is super friendly. Looks like it was remodeled. Fits that modern vibe! Portion sizes are huge for the price, so that's a definite plus for me. More bank for your buck, am I right? As someone with a small stomach, I couldn't finish the entire meal, so I took it home for the next day. Still just as good.  I got the plate with lamb kebab. So good! Will be coming back to try their chicken kebab plate. They also have a Yelp Check-In offer, so don't forget about that ;)\n",

      "Just got my predictable angry reply by the owner. I'll keep it short. It's pretty telling that the owner says things like \"I'm sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review\". Implying that I'm in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it's \"pretend false\" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn't happen and I didn't come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.I'm sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. The rest of what you're saying, I'll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of \"Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn't be allowed to review!\". That's not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. I don't really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.Of course there is deception, if you're saying \"Salad or rice\" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying \"Fries ok with the wrap?\", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren't going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It's smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it's taxes and such), they don't find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.Yes, it's worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you \"You don't have normal water outside of these bottles?\" to which you replied \"No, sorry\". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?I'll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it's pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using 'cost-effective' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I'll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.I note you said the reason that you didn't offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I'll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don't like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner's responses to other negative responses.  All are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don't enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don't talk about your experience if you didn't pay in your party, it doesn't count apparently!Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.\n",

Delicious, the only think missing is the whiskey lol.  Definitely recommend it if your in the area. Great service as well.\n",

      "Wow! What a gem this turned out to be! Was in town for business yesterday and grabbed some lunch here. Went with the chicken kebab plate which came with 1/2 rice 1/2 salad, grilled veggies and a side of pita bread. I particularly liked their mint sauce which came with the bread - nice touch vs. the usual hummus you get in other places. Food takes about 15 mins to cook but the meat is so tender and fresh...worth the wait!\n",

      "Found this place just from walking around in the area and I'm so glad I took a chance because WOW! I ordered the Salmon Kebab and it was delicious! Sometimes I need more lemon to give salmon more flavor but this one didn't need it. I asked for half & half of their Greek salad and rice for my sides and it was perfect. They also brought out slices of pita bread with a tasty green sauce as our starter. It was so good, that we ordered some to-go. Definitely coming back!\n",

      "Omg can I just say to die for! Ordered via Postmates for the first time and I must say that you for sure get what you paid for. The chicken is extra tender and not burned at all like other places. The veggies and rice are super fresh. I will for sure to order here from now on.\n",

      "Wow what a find especially for those doing keto! Went for the first time today with my husband and father/mother in law. My father in law is new to keto and asked us to find somewhere we could go to lunch that is keto friendly and I'm so glad we found kebab place! We ordered the keto platter and everything was amazing. Everything tasted extremely fresh with great flavor. We also ordered the salmon kebab/Greek salad. It was all delicious and we will definitely be back. It is hard to find places to go out to eat that serve truly keto dishes that also taste good and this place is a win! The service was also amazing and loved the ambiance of the place. We will definitely be back!!\n",

      "Service was good, food is great. I ordered the Sultan platter which came with three kebabs: chicken, ground sirloin, and my choice of lamb. All meats were good and flavorful. The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.\n",

      "So so good. We got the Sultan Platter and the Gyro Kebab , every single bite was delicious. We overshot how much food we should order but don't mind having leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. It came out to about 63 dollars for our meal but It's so so worth it. Every single bite was so fresh and tasty. We'll probably just stick to ordering the Sultan platter for the two of us to share next time. But again, so worth it. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Downtown Santa Ana has no shortage destinations to eat. Luckily I work super duper close and this was one of the first places I checked out. Specializing in fresh made to order kebabs, salads, wraps. This place deserves a gold star. Located on 4th street in the hope you find parking zone. Bring those quarters for the meter. Or call in your order and park in the structure and take advantage of their 20 minute validation.The chicken Kebab plate is off the hook. Served with rice, salad and warm pita bread. Paired with garlic sauce and a green sauce. Chicken is super moist and flavorful. In fact, I couldnt help myself and busted open my box on my way home and grabbed a bite. It was so good.

      "If you don't eat a lot of Lebanese/Persian food, then the food seems good, but bad Persian food is still good. Compared to most places, the food is only okay. The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant. Free water please.Waitress was sweet but owner seems like a prick outside of his superficial politeness. Just weird unfriendly vibe that I don't encounter too often in restaurants.\n",

      "If you are looking for mediocre Mediterranean, then don't come here! This place is fantastic!!! Fresh, flavorful, locally sourced meats and veggies and house made sauces. As a family we eat low carb / Keto, so we are meat and veggie connoisseurs. The salmon, chicken, steak, gyro and hamburgers were all top notch! The portions are huge. The establishment was clean and tastefully decorated and the food was presented beautifully. We are visiting from out of state and have eaten at a couple of fine dining establishments that couldn't compare with the food we ate here. The owner / manager was so nice and accommodating. Seriously, do yourself a favor and enjoy a meal here. I really wish Kebab Place was back in my home state.\n",

      "Great food and service! This place is a little pricier than the average on-the-go places; however, the portions are worth the pay! I ordered the salmon kabob plate and it was absolutely delicious! Their green sauce is pretty good too! I haven't seen or tried that certain sauce at other Mediterranean restaurants. I came during lunch time and the wait was not long.\n"

      "If you don't eat a lot of Lebanese/Persian food, then the food seems good, but bad Persian food is still good. Compared to most places, the food is only okay. The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant. Free water please.Waitress was sweet but owner seems like a prick outside of his superficial politeness. Just weird unfriendly vibe that I don't encounter too often in restaurants.\n",

      "If you are looking for mediocre Mediterranean, then don't come here! This place is fantastic!!! Fresh, flavorful, locally sourced meats and veggies and house made sauces. As a family we eat low carb / Keto, so we are meat and veggie connoisseurs. The salmon, chicken, steak, gyro and hamburgers were all top notch! The portions are huge. The establishment was clean and tastefully decorated and the food was presented beautifully. We are visiting from out of state and have eaten at a couple of fine dining establishments that couldn't compare with the food we ate here. The owner / manager was so nice and accommodating. Seriously, do yourself a favor and enjoy a meal here. I really wish Kebab Place was back in my home state.\n",

I'm a particularly picky person when I eat, and I loved just about everything there.The marinated chicken was super flavorful. I don't know how to describe the flavors I was experiencing, other than to say it was delicious.The sauces are a highlight of meal for sure!\n",

I ordered the salmon kabob plate and it was absolutely delicious! Their green sauce is pretty good too! I haven't seen or tried that certain sauce at other Mediterranean restaurants. I came during lunch time and the wait was not long.\n"

      "Now that this location was shut down for a Rodent infestation I will no longer be coming to this location. I don't understand how a restaurant could allow themselves to get that disgusting. Don't you disinfect and sanitize the entire kitchen? Obviously not if the city has to come shut the establishment down because of such unhealthy working environment. Unfortunately the owner of the company the more mature lady was always rude and angry when approached. I try to make an order and she gave me a look of disgust. Make she wonder if you really value this restaurant or not. If I was a restaurant business owner I would take customer service 100% to the next level. Without customers there's no business.\n",

      "The food is great. The owner is rude and it's VERY clear that he's cheap. Which is why I'm giving two stars. I ate here a few times and the last time I went, the owner made a big deal over the tiniest CUBE of baklava that I asked for since you get one for free when you check in. He snarked \"you have to eat here! That's the whole point.\" Um ok? It was disgusting anyway. I decided not to come back. I will not support businesses that have terrible service. Especially when your food is pricey. I've read so many similar reviews like mine, so none of this comes as a shock. & of course the owner angrily responds over what ? The free baklava  of course that would be the only thing he got from this review. You have TERRIBLE customer service and need to humble yourself. People are spending a lot of money on your food. How petty is it to get upset over a cube of baklava. How about a \"hey thank you for ordering from us, here you go.\" How about a \"we have some tables open if you would like to stay and dine in.\" I wasn't exploiting any offer. Because I STAYED and ate at the tables outside. But you were so quick to jump down my throat because I ordered online. I planned on eating there. WORK ON YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS! They're lacking immensely!\n",

      "I was downtown waiting for a business meeting.  Lunch time hit and we looked around.  Saw this place and decided to go in.  I personally love places like this.  Little shops that just give you good food.Walked up to the counter and grabbed a menu.  I had the chicken kebab platter.  The guy behind the counter who looked kind of like one of the bad guys from the Christopher Reeves Superman movie was super friendly.  Definitely not the bad guy.  He asked if I wanted half rice and half salad, which sounded perfect.  Grabbed a drink from the cooler, paid and we sat to wait for our food.  Another guy brought over a little something to chew on, which was good.  It didn't take long for the food to come by.  It was great.  So good.  The chicken had a little spice, but was perfect with the yogurt sauce they gave.I live nowhere near here, but if I was in the area, I would be there often.  The food was great, the people there were awesome, and the price was right.  Cannot recommend this enough.\n",

      "Agree with Daniel Z.'s review revealing that they are *very* deceitful. It just gives me a bad feeling about the ownership and I prefer to support businesses that are ethical, honest, and customer-oriented rather than ones that engage in tactics to be sneaky about nickel-and-diming or price gouging customers. Makes me wonder what shortcuts they are taking with food/ingredients to penny pinch. I ordered a gyro wrap, and it came complete with surprise extra charges for offered sauces and fries which were pictured on the menu *with* the wrap and the listed price for a wrap; and, when I ordered, he simply said, \"fries ok for the wrap?\" instead of asking me, \"Do you want to add fries for $4\" or whatever. He also offered me the choice of a sauce from a list of I believe 3, never letting me know that it'd be another couple of extra dollars if I made a selection lol. Ended up doubling what I thought I was paying for a quick lunch, and I didn't really enjoy the meal itself. Beware guys--I won't be back.\n",

      "Food was delicious. I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.\n",

      "I thought the food here was decent.  Sadly, the experience I had here was truly a disappointment and deterred from any of the positives I experienced.I visited this establishment during lunch time to grab a quick bite.  In the area that it's located, it was a super quiet street.  Everything is street parking with it being metered pay during the day.  It was very quiet for a lunch time with not too many people dining in.My biggest complaint was the service I received.  For the place not being so busy, it took forever for someone to take my order and then even longer for my food to come out.  The lady serving me was not very attentive and was very rude about everything.  She kind of threw my food on the table when she finally got it to me.  And when taking a peak back into the kitchen, everything done did not seem too sanitary.  The lady at the cash register was serving food in between taking orders and handing bills without washing her hands in between which I'm sure you're not suppose to do.On a positive note, they offer complimentary pita bread and a green herby dipping sauce which came out warm and delicious.  The gyro meat was decent, a little on the salty side.  It was a good portion sizing for one person.\n",

      "Mediterranean cravings brought me to this place. There are pictures on the walls with some of their items. We ordered the sultan's plate for dinner. It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place. There are not many places that make me drive to Santa Ana, but I'm telling you, this one is worth it.\n",

You can taste the freshness of the salmon in every single bite, not frozen for sure I know my salmon pretty well, it has such a delicious and delicate taste, the spices on it really compliments the entire dish. Now onto the chicken, it's always super moist and delicious, definitely recommend the chicken kebab plate along with the basmati rice and their delicious salad. Last but not least the PITA bread!!!! Oh my goodness it's so soft, and fluffy and the green dip.....!!!!! Makes you literally want to feed off of it and bathe in it lol!!!!

The chicken kabob was moist and delicious with the right seasoning. The rice was simple, yet tasty. And the salad was served with some sort of balsamic dressing and it was good.

      "Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up! All in all, if you decide to give this place a try you won't regret one bite.\n",

We weren't too sure on what to expect once we pulled up since it was a small store and everything around it was closed already, but the owner (I think) was really nice and helped us order up front. He also took time to review the items when he dropped it off and chatted with us for a bit. Their house made cilantro dip is to die for! We ordered the Sultan platter which had 3 skewers and we opted for half rice and half salad and also got their waffle fries. In hindsight we could've went without the fries, but everything was SO GOOD! My husband could not stop talking about how good it all was.

Looks like this will be added to the rotationI ordered the combo kebab, chicken and steak with half rice and salad. It also came with complimentary warm pita and a tasty dipping sauce.

I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat. I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.\n",

I highly recommend trying this food whether you share a plate or get your own bc it's so bomb! We even met the chef which adds his Mexican touch to everything so you know it's gonna to be well seasoned! I'm most definitely going to keep going!\n",

      "Came in when they had just opened. The workers seemed a little puzzled with multiple orders they had from a big party. After that was completed the customer service was a lot better!The food.... amazing. It was the best meat the best salad I've had in a long time. This place has fresh food that tastes great!  Can't wait to be back!\n",

      "Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be.  Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's  not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.\n",
      "page: 4 -------------\n",
      "You can taste the quality in their food. I ordered the platter and I must say it is enough food for two to share. I opted for no rice this time. The wait for food is a little long. But, it is cooked to order and super fresh. If you are in a lunch rush, you may want to order ahead.  I can see myself becoming a regular here. :)\n",
      "page: 4 -------------\n",
      "Walking into the restaurant there is a Zen vibe and you are greeted by the friendly and attentive staff.  The food selections are amazing, we treated ourselves to the Sultan platter which was a combination of lamb steak ground beef Shawarma and salmon with dill seasoning it was also accompanied by basmati rice and Mediterranean salad which was unbelievable.  The meats were perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of flavor and seasoning; the portions were very generous with a very nice presentation.  I'd highly recommend this to friends and family for dine in or take out.\n",
      "page: 4 -------------\n",
      "Taste: 5/5 however they charge for water, and they made it seem like I had an option of half salad half rice then charged me $2 for it. In the end i spent $36.48 for a cup of water and one sultan platter which seems a bit much for being two dollar signs.\n"

The cilantro sauce with the warm pita bread was by far some of the best pita and sauce I've tried! I can not recommend this place enough! Only thing I would recommend is I went with my sister in law who is vegan she ordered the falafel salad that she enjoyed a lot but felt that they could've done a better job at promoting their vegan options! But they did offer to put a veggie patty into a Gyro for her which was great! All in all five star for sure!!\n",

      "Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.\n",

We tried dolmas and baclava too and I'm no expert but absolutely the best I've ever.I will 100% be coming back many many more times.They accidentally brought out a chicken wrap instead of the felafel wrap but the owner had a fresh wrap made and the chicken wrap was boxed and given to a homeless guy outside. Amazing my dude thank you for this food I can tell it comes from your heart\n",

      "I would never have found this great Persian kabob place if not for the 2017 rendition of Savor Santa Ana. I earmarked the spot as I planned my path through the different zones on the provided map and calculated the cost per ticket for the right balance of cuisines and cocktails. Damn right I needed a drink!Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!\n",

      "One of my work mates wanted kebab, so off to Yelp and then to here to check it out.  I am glad we came, because it is straight up tasty.  It is tiny shop closer to the Courthouse than the new renovations in DTSA, but worth trying if you are looking for Greek and Mediterranean food.  I wouldn't call it fusion, but they do step away from some of the traditional fare to cater to a more diverse set of tastes, but hey, that is what food in So Cal is all about.It definitely hit the spot for the day, and it is a place worth going back to again./\n",
      "page: 5 -------------\n",
      "Simple no-nonsense good, fresh food at a fair price.  I enjoyed the Lamb Kabob.  It was prepared with tasty spices, rice and/or salad, baked tomato and green pepper.  I am a BIG eater and was very full after just the one meal.I cannot wait to try the Gyro Breakfast Wrap.About the parking....  It is not easy to drive in, eat, and drive away.  You have to be really lucky or visit during midday on a weekday to park right out front on 4th Street.But there is easy parking very close.  Within a block there is a cheap/free city parking garage.Downtown Santa Ana is generally a good walking destination anyway.  I usually combine a meal at the Kebab Place with a visit to \"Good Beer\" brewery across the street or a desert at the 4th Street Market(try Front Porch Pops or Chunk N Chip), and/or a film at the Frida Cinema.  Fourth Street is a great place to walk around, shop, eat, and experience.\n",

It's very rare the food actually looks like the pictures some places post. Being from out of town, we looked at all the Greek places on Yelp and decided to gave them a try. What a treat. The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes,  loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted. I will gladly pay a few dollars more to get the quality of food that Rok served us tonight.

      "I decided to come to Kebab Place based off of the location and the reviews. The ambiance of this location is amazing and very peaceful. The music was a bit too loud at times . As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.\n",

When I asked for a cup of water she pointed to the bottle waters in the cooler. When I said no and I again asked for a cup of water she pointed to a water dispenser on the counter. Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture. Gyro portion was ok but the wrap was overwhelmed by lettuce Price- poor $9.95 for my disappointing lunch of a gyro pita sandwich and no sides. Recommendation - don't go.  Go to Crave down the street for a great sandwich,soup and/or salad\n",

      "Now that was some good gyro.  The meat was temperature hot, moist, tender and not too salty.  It even had some crispy ends which was a pleasant surprise.  While the food took a while, likely because they were preparing a catering order.  During the wait, some hot pita bread and olive oil dipping sauce.  But back to the plate, the salad and rice were good as well.\n",

My main Gripe was the unfriendly person at the register and the \"Stoner fries\" have nothing that makes them especially \"stoner\". Maybe add some stoner sauce to them fries and I would be happy.  Seems kinda pricy, I think the order taker was the manager taking advantage of intoxicated patrons.\n",

      "Chicken kebab wrap! The staff is so nice and friendly but the food was a-okay. I got the wrap and ate it only 5 minutes after I received it. However, it was incredibly soggy already as the juices from the meat had permeated the wrapping. At the end, I was eating a bite of the wrap with a fork while trying to get pieces of meat and tomato with my hands. Everything was torn up and dripping. It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food! You would not run into the problem I ran into with the plates, but insofar as I ate the wrap, I have nothing more to say!\n",

      "Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch.  Everything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable.  So having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go.  It took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?).  I took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside.  The sauces provided were fresh and tasty.  So I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office.  The ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line.  I walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap.  I got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops.  I won't make that mistake again.  Not that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious!  Chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  I could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is.  I thought the portion size was perfect and the service was friendly and the food was very flavorful.  Some people just can't be pleased with anything.\n",
      "page: 8 -------------\n",
      "Found Kebab Place totally by accident but so glad I did. Dragged my reluctant wife there and she had the best tasting, big juicy burger she's ever had Ever! I had the salmon kebab and I couldn't have been happier. Everything was perfect, from the rice to the succulent pieces of marinated salmon. The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant. All that was missing was a nice glass of wine. They don't have their alcohol license yet, but I understand they are working on it. Im picky about my food and I have to say my tummy was happy and satisfied well after we had gone. I highly recommend this restaurant! Please tell Roc I sent you!\n",

      "I usually don't yelp any places but after coming here I had too make a statement about this place . I was really disappointed it about the portion of food & the price is way to high would I go back No\n",

      "This place has got to be one of my favorite Mediterranean spot in santa ana. Ordered the sultan platter and it had 3 different types of meat to choose from. Rok helped us out with a smile and also gave us extra complimentary pita bread! This place Roks!\n"

      "Came here with co-workers for lunch for the first time.  My co workers were raving about it and it didn't disappoint.  Located in Downtown Santa Ana, it's a great place for kabobs.  We went up to the counter to order and one of the owners was at the register. He was super helpful with answering some questions on the menu. He was super friendly!The pita bread with the dipping sauce was super good.  The dipping sauce was nice and refreshing!  I ordered the Koobideh platter which was super good. I definitely want to come back to try the chicken kabobs (which I hear is a favorite) and the other portions on the menu.\n",
      "page: 9 -------------\n",
      "3 1/2 stars for this visit.  My original lunch plans was to try the new Irenia located next to the Rags newspaper stand, but apparently they don't bother to post on the door they're NOT open for lunch on Tuesdays.  So we walked around the corner and spied Kebab Place, located across the street from Starbucks.  They advertised their \"highly recommended\" chicken kebab plate for $11.99.The place is tiny and narrow. There's counter seating along the wall, and 4 or 5 tables for 2 or 4 people along the other wall, and a few tables outside.  I wasn't too happy you have to crane your neck to read the menu posted above the order counter.  Yes, its big but it's also 10 feet above you.There's no \"lunch specials\" here, or combos like a chicken and a beef plate, or a soup and salad combo. We decided on the recommended Chicken Kebob.  My coworker Anna had it with rice only, while I had the rice and salad combo for the same price.While we waited, we received a basket of hot. freshly grilled pita bread.  We were fortunate that we were the first one there, so our food didn't take long.  While we were eating, the place got filled up pretty fast.The only difference between my chicken plate and Anna's rice only plate is Anna got an extra tomato and no salad, while I got a bowl of salad but heavy on the vinaigrette dressing. Very tart and sour!  If you want a salad, ask for the dressing on the side.My chicken plate with a canned soda (only a buck, cheaper than a fountain drink) came to $14 and change after tax.  I gave $15 and told them to keep the change.Overall, not bad.  I've had better Persian/ Middle Eastern food. The chicken had good flavor but a bit dry.  The portion is adequate for lunch, but for $12, I'd rather go to Panini Grill at the MainPlace Mall for more.I'd come back if I didn't want to drive my car, as its only 2 blocks from my office.\n",
      "page: 9 -------------\n",
      "Such good food! Try the gyro plate, it's one of the best I've ever had. The warm pita, delicious green sauce, Mediterranean side salad and perfectly sliced gyro just made for an awesome combination. Would definitely return after this great meal. Service is super friendly and it is in a great location.\n",
      "page: 9 -------------\n",
      "Ordered couple of times here. Their kobideh and chicken kabab are perfect. For the side I'd definitely recommend their felafel. In general, good place to have lunch.\n",
      "page: 9 -------------\n",
      "Came here on a slow weekday for takeout when I was passing by the block. Upon entering I was greeted by a gentleman at the cashier and placed my order. Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant.  Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.\n",

The salmon had a crispy sear on the outside but soft on the inside, just delish.  The pita was really warm and soft. I could've made a meal out of the pita and assorted dips alone, it was that good. Restaurant was clean, food came out quick and the new owner was really nice and energetic. We were occasion visitors before but will definitely make it a regular thing. They have a really creative breakfast menu I'd like to try. See you there!!\n",

      "Well here it is the big 400, does it really matter? Or does it mean I have to much time on my hands? Nonsense lets talk about this awesome little gem in DTSA. Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!\n",

      "This is the first restaurant I have tried in downtown Santa Ana and was on the ok side. The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.\n",

      "Love this place!!!Food:  Everything here is amazing!! Fresh and delicious!!  This is by far the best kabab place I've tasted in a while.  The pita was perfectly heated and served with amazing house sauce that you must try.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked, and the gyro plates were huge and perfect!  The kids, husband, and I walked away perfectly happy!Service:  The manager here is friendly and treats each customer like family.  You get service with a kind smile!  On a cold evening, it was the perfect place to warm up and get a great meal!Location:  The restaurant is a little tough to spot because it's between stores.  It's worth the search!  There's plenty of shopping nearby to make it a nice lunch or dinner location. Parking:  There's meter parking out front and a garage not too far away.  The meters accept credit cards as well as coins.  Overall:  Fabulous and definitely worth a try!!!\n",

I ordered two combination plates and got a salad instead... I contacted them right after which was no help because they did nothing to fix the issue. I did tip the delivery guy, although I got the wrong order and bad attitude, he still delivered it in the rain.\n",

I ask them to make it over after waiting she comes back and hands me the wrong order...wtf...then brings me my food finally after waiting for over 25 minutes...get back to the office and there is no taziki sauce on the gyro. Meat is good but no sauce..really ? Will never be back. So rude. Calling me a liar.\n",

      "I came here during my lunch break and had an awesome experience. The owner Rok was welcoming and helped me choose my meal. I'm not too familiar with Mediterranean food lol. I had the falafel plate and my friend had a falafel wrap. It was probably THE BEST Falafel we've ever had, the inside was moist and the outside was crunchy! Definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu. Highly recommend trying this restaurant out!\n",

Grape leafs were ok but missing the lemon and lamb flavor to make them authentic . Falafel was poor and the salad, led leb salad, was the furthest thing from a Arabic salad. Get the right stuff and it's a good meal.\n",

      "Our second experience with Kebab Place. The first was takeout and the second was dine in. Both five stars. Regarding dine in,the restaurant was very clean and the ambience warm. Rok,the owner,helped us decide what to order. We had a platter that had three proteins (organic chicken, steak, and ground beef), rice, and several sauces. Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food. An enjoyable time. Rok goes out of his way to make sure his customers are well taken care of. Great dining experience!!! Can't wait to come back!!\n",

I love the atmosphere and the coziness of the place it reminded me of beach trips to Boracay, Philippines and Thailand. Awesome playlist, great and authentic sauces, and the icing on the cake was rose-water rich baklava on the house. What a beautiful experience for a first-timer. Thank you and see you soon!\n",

The rice is always old(smells like socks), the beef was burnt, and the service was bad. Very disappointed. Spent $15 and left hungry. Didn't finish even half my plate. Old management was way better. Should've asked for my money back but the guy at the front looked like he didn't care\n",

Prior to my arrival I phoned the establishment and spoke with Gita who was very sweet in taking down my order and provided some tips on keeping the food/dessert fresh out in the desert. Once I got to kebab place, I was greeted by Gita and a gentleman named Rock (owner) who was speaking very highly of the food and baklava. We discussed the business and the menu and I decided to order the Mediterranean burger so that I could provide an honest Yelp review. The burger was very tasty/juicy and I was given a slice of baklava upon finsihing my meal.The gang at kebab place spoke a big game and needless to say the bakalava was without a doubt some of the best I've ever eaten. My campmates also appluaded the quality of the baklava and I was compelled to leave a positive review!!! Will definitely be seeing Rock and Gita in the near future.\n",

      "The service here was good, the restaurant was clean and well maintained.I had the Chicken Kebab wrap, it was mediocre at best. Chicken was on the bland side and the wrap, for $10, was small.My lady had the Gyro Wrap, which was much better albeit saltier. The gyro meat was good and moist. But still for $12.50 with fries was overpriced. Comparable restaurants such as Doner G, or Pita Hot are under $10 for the same meal. Would not likely come back here, as there are so many better Mediterranean places in Orange County.\n",

      "This is for my experience with ordering delivery through Yelp. Here are the reasons why I am giving this place 1 star:1) I placed the order a little after 12 pm for 3 items. food was to be delivered at 1:12 pm, at :1:20 pm I called to get an update and the lady that answers the phone abruptly tells me the driver is on the way. No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience. I was not given the impression that the restaurant wanted to make things right with me as I have a valid reason to be upset. I'm sitting here writing this email hangry btw.\n",

When I tried to order in person what I had ordered thru doordash one week prior, he told me their system was different and that he'd have to charge me for two separate kabobs which came out to $5 extra.. so $20 for one plate! The right thing to do from a customer service standpoint would've been to honor that price shown online. Very disappointing. Won't bother going there again.\n",

The food was fresh and flavorful! The portion size is large and fulfilling. We are already planning to try the grilled salmon kebob next time.  If your not in the mood for kebobs, they also have burgers and gyros with fries.

That is the first issue. I had to eat fast to get back in time.The second issue was the price. 20 bucks for one lamb kebob, rice, and really really bad babaganooj. Like the worst I have ever had, that bad. It didn't even have the right texture or taste like eggplant. That brings me to the food. The two stars are because at least the lamb was tasty.

The food was delicious (I got the gyro platter) and the man that worked there was super nice. You order at the counter and then take a seat, but instead of just calling our names out and giving us our food, he took care of it and stopped by often to refill our water and take away our finished plates. The platter comes with a salad and rice, and my friend got the falafel platter which came with fries (and I love fries). It was empty when we came in, probably because this place delivers and I assume most people just get to-go, but it's very nice place that I'm glad I was able to come across.\n",

      "Based on the other good reviews chose to eat here for lunch. GPS took me a to a beer joint across the street. It's a small little spot with one sign out front so might be easy to miss driving by. We ended up ordering the gyro beef plate and falafel plate. The falafel plate was very flavorful. Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalapeño cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice. Well priced for the amount and quality of food Inside the place is small but clean. Would definitely go back again when in the area.\n",

It has a warm atmosphere and the menu is super easy to read with a lot of good, traditional Arab dishes. Starter:They hit me with some pita bread and their house sauce. It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice. Spot is great. Definitely coming back. The guys here do a top notch job. Supporting small places like this is a must. Try them out.\n",

      "This place is a true diamond in the rough. I've eaten at so many Mediterranean spots in SoCal, and while I love the general flavor of it all, I have not found a \"go to\" restaurant until I stumbled upon Kebab Place. My boyfriend and I ordered the special fillet steak wrap, stoner greek fries, and the combo platter. Every meal comes with complimentary pita bread and a cilantro/jalapeno house sauce (both pita and sauce were pure magick). They also gave us complimentary lentil soup which was very hearty as well as tasty. The fillet mignon in the steak wrap was superior. Marinated, tender, excellent portion. The gyro in the stoner greek fries was perhaps the best gyro I've had. It wasn't dry and was very well seasoned. The hummus, babaganouj, and tzatziki dips were all perfection. Dolmades were delish.I have nothing bad to say about this place. Customer service was great. Food came out quickly, but not too quickly. By the taste of the food, you can tell everything is fresh and dedication and thoughtfulness is flowing through that kitchen. The price, I considered moderate on it's face. But once you taste the quality of their meals, it is a bargain for this kind of fresh, well made meal.Any time I am near Main and 4th, I'm stopping by!\n",

I would have gladly payed for an extra one.  The parking is limited but not impossible to find parking. Bring change there are parking meters. It was easy to find with directions from yelp. And is located right across the street from a Starbucks.  The place is rather small or cozy. I ate outside because it was a bit crowded inside and most tables were taken. But that's not a bad thing as I enjoyed eating outside. I would recommend this place because of the tasty food. But if you are in a rush y oui u should call your order in. I called my order in and it was cooked fresh in about 15 minutes more or less. I was on lunch break from work so calling ahead to place the order was very convenient. The service was friendly and prices reasonable considering the freshness and the taste. I would visit again if I'm ever in the area.\n",

Perfect crunchy texture on the outside and soft on the inside and it was not drenched in oil or sauce.  I'd come back to try the chicken kabob which looked delectable My friend got the fries with steak and said it was scrumptious.\n",

      "Let me start off by saying WOW! I am so happy that I stopped in and experienced the food here. It was truly something special. The chicken is AMAZING... So tender, flavorful and juicy... AND it's organic! The Gyro was the best I've had. The Baklava was sinfully moist and flavorful and went down well with the in house brewed black tea (with hints of cardamom). This place is awesome.\n",

Try the soup!  It's VERY good!Salad was VERY fresh and super tasty!  A HINT of mint in the vinaigrette!  Salad had dived tomato and cucumber with a hint of onion.  Very authentic!The pita was warm and the hummus was pretty good as well with a dash of paprika.  The green sauce was VERY good as well!The chicken kebab platter came next.  Excellent chicken (not too spicy) and cocked perfectly.  NOT dry nor burnt!  Well done!  The rice was also well done and authentic.  A grilled Hot Pepper was served on the site with a grilled tomato garnish.  The tzakiki sauce is REALLY good!Over all, an excellent experience.  Great for a date with cozy tables!Loved it!\n",

I recently began the transition to a vegan lifestyle and I was still able to find an option that fit my needs! The falafel is filling, tasty, and vegan! Just be sure to request no feta on your salad. Oh, and the green sauce? That stuff is so good they need to start selling jars of that stuff.\n",

The staff and their customer service was great. I ordered a lamb Kebab... I typically don't eat meat...but I love how light lamb is. The plate was very big and my lamb kebab was fresh and savory. The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend sharing the plates!They have a variety of different things on their menu. I snagged a few menus to take back with me to my studio.

It's about a 10 minute walk from the courthouse and it's a nice easy walk...we all got fresh air. It's mostly middle eastern style food...reminds me of the Grill Hut but a hipper, cooler version. I had the gyros wrap and it was amazing! It had so much meat on it and the meat had perfect flavor.  It was a large portion too.....I was really full afterward!Some of my lunch partners had the kabob plate and it was a kabob, rice, and salad and they said it was great too. We were able to walk here, order, eat, and make it back on time with 10 mins to spare. If you are in jury duty, I recommend walking here for lunch....it beats the court cafeteria by far!!

Even brought out some samples of the appetizers of hummus and their special green sauce.  The chicken was marinated to perfection and was the best chicken I have had that I can recall.  The bed of saffron rice was delicious and the salad and the dressing was nice compliment to the rest of the food.  The stoner fries were a big hit and is definitely great as a shareable.  The price was very reasonable, especially for what you got.

We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price).  I said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation. I felt that they didn't give us the correct food and didn't want to rectify the situation. I was disappointed and wish they had priced their food correctly especially since it is so good\n",

      "I don't know what the deal is with this place. I came by because I was on jury duty and it had good reviews here on Yelp. I was supremely disappointed. I gave two stars rather than one ONLY because the employees were friendly.First of all, the place was nearly empty when I got there (I beat the rush), but it still took over 20 minutes to get my food. A rush came in after I sat down; I can't imagine how long they must have been waiting. I did notice that some takeout orders were going out, so maybe that's what slowed them down. Regardless, when you have a limited time for lunch, a 20 minute wait is not great.Secondly, the food was really weird. I ordered a lamb kebab platter. I got a large oval plate with a HUGE amount of rice (seriously, probably 2X or 3X the amount of rice I'm used to getting at places like this), maybe 4-5oz of meat, two pieces of grilled tomato, one half of a jalapeño, and 4 triangles of pita. Oh, and about a tablespoon of sauce in a small container. The meat tasted reasonably good (maybe a little over-cooked), the pita was ok, and I liked the sauce. But the proportions of everything were way out of whack. I almost laughed when I saw how much rice there was in comparison to vegetables and meat.I almost never complain about pricing on Yelp because I'm happy to pay for good food (and I think people are way too quick to complain that something is \"overpriced\"). But this is unreasonable enough that I can't in good conscience let is pass without mention. For the aforementioned plate of mostly rice with a little bit of meat, plus a fountain soda (more on that in a moment), I paid just over $18. Plus tip - there's a tip line on the receipt, and I would have felt like a jerk leaving it blank, so make it $21.Finally, something was really off with the fountain drink. I ordered Diet Coke, and it tasted nothing like Diet Coke. I'm not sure if it was a knockoff brand, or the syrup was expired, or what, but it was NOT Diet Coke. It also had a bit of a \"musty\" taste to it. Maybe just poor quality product, or maybe the equipment wasn't clean? Anyway, I took a few sips and threw it out. I'll also note that the fountain is behind the register, so you can't regulate your own ice/soda ratio or do your own refills (an extremely minor point that wouldn't warrant a mention if it weren't for all the other stuff).Anyway, maybe I came on an off day and ordered the wrong stuff. I don't know what else explains all of the very positive reviews of this place. Believe it or not, I'm a pretty positive person, I like most of the places I eat, and I only leave negative reviews on Yelp if I think it's important. In this case, my experience was bad enough, and the other reviews so out of sync with it, that I feel I HAVE to add some balance.One other probably irrelevant point I should mention. Last time I was on jury duty, about two years ago, I had an eerily similar experience at a different restaurant in this EXACT SAME location. It was a burger place, it had a bunch of really positive reviews, the wait was long, and the food mediocre. Maybe this location is cursed? Maybe I am? I don't know. All I can say is that next time I have jury duty, I will not eat at whatever restaurant happens to be occupying this storefront. There are plenty of other good places to eat near by.\n",

I've never tasted anything that comes even close. My go to is the chicken kebab plate . A MUST try! I also get a side of hummus which is to die for. My boyfriend had the steak plate and loved it as well. A tip if you're grabbing your meal to go around lunch time, call ahead! Trust me! The line just to order can take around 20 minutes and then you'll be waiting for your food to be made after that. It's definitely worth the wait though. I live an hour plus away but work around the corner. It's so good, I would bear the drive on my off day to have it :) don't take my word for it. See for yourself!\n",

They were generous with the portion of gyro, the lamb/beef gyro had delightful seasoning, the pita was nice and warm, and my favorite part of this gyro wrap was the tatziki and the feta cheese spread on the pita bread.  Overall, I had a pleasant time consuming my wrap and will definitely coming back to try their, \"Stoner Fries.\"\n",

      "I recently visited downtown Santa Ana for the first time in over 5 years. The area is quite charming and full of locals and tourists. Kebab Place sits right across the Starbucks, about a block or so from Chapter One (another one of my favorite spots). I was pleasantly surprised to find a very clean, modern spot, with a great Persian/Greek-inspired menu. Lots of delicious options to choose from. The great thing about this place is that although it's casual, the portions are large and the food is mouth watering. Kebab Place even serves up a special \"creamy cilantro\" sauce- absolutely delicious with the hot pita bread served on the side with your dish. I would highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner. I got a chance to chat with the new owner (Hooman), and he mentioned that they'll start to serve breakfast wraps and sandwiches soon. I think it'll be a great option for the many office buildings and residents around the area. I'll definitely be visiting again very soon!\n",

The original gyro wrap is one of my absolute favorite from the menu! The Gyro meat is scrumptious, another great must try are the STONER FRIES, omg you get full, just with that plate alone, gyro meat, feta cheese, taziki sauce on top. The seasoned fries are bomb ASF, super delicious, made as soon as you order! By far the greatest tasting food in DOWNTOWN! Great place, small but great for social gatherings. I visit almost daily . Staff is very friendly, and helpful. Owner of restaurant is a great character, sweet, and very caring of his customers. 100% satisfied with the food quality & service!\n",

Next she brought me salad and pita bread with a green sauce. I'm not sure what the sauce was but it tasted like a cilantro jalapeño cucumber sauce. It was amazing as well. Then my entrée came.

I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed. It's listed as a must try and it really is a must try dish. I highly recommend this place for delicious fresh made dishes to satisfy many cravings and make sure you try their lentil soup!\n",

I'll keep it short. <br/><br/>It's pretty telling that the owner says things like \"I'm sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review\". Implying that I'm in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it's \"pretend false\" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn't happen and I didn't come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.<br/><br/>I'm sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The rest of what you're saying, I'll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of \"Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn't be allowed to review!\". That's not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. <br/><br/>I don't really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.<br/><br/>Of course there is deception, if you're saying \"Salad or rice\" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying \"Fries ok with the wrap?\", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren't going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It's smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it's taxes and such), they don't find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.<br/><br/>Yes, it's worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you \"You don't have normal water outside of these bottles?\" to which you replied \"No, sorry\". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?<br/><br/>I'll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it's pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using 'cost-effective' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I'll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.<br/><br/>I note you said the reason that you didn't offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I'll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.<br/><br/>You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don't like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner's responses to other negative responses.  All are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don't enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don't talk about your experience if you didn't pay in your party, it doesn't count apparently!<br/><br/>Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.</span></p>,\n",

I ordered the Sultan platter which came with three kebabs: chicken, ground sirloin, and my choice of lamb. All meats were good and flavorful. The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.</span></p>,\n",

Luckily I work super duper close and this was one of the first places I checked out. Specializing in fresh made to order kebabs, salads, wraps. This place deserves a gold star. <br/><br/>Located on 4th street in the hope you find parking zone. Bring those quarters for the meter. Or call in your order and park in the structure and take advantage of their 20 minute validation.<br/><br/>The chicken Kebab plate is off the hook. Served with rice, salad and warm pita bread. Paired with garlic sauce and a green sauce. Chicken is super moist and flavorful. In fact, I couldnt help myself and busted open my box on my way home and grabbed a bite. It was so good. House made salad dressing was one of the best I've had.<br/><br/>Service is friendly. The owner takes great pride in his food.

It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant.

I ordered the Sultan platter which came with three kebabs: chicken, ground sirloin, and my choice of lamb. All meats were good and flavorful. The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.</span></p>,\n",

Or call in your order and park in the structure and take advantage of their 20 minute validation.<br/><br/>The chicken Kebab plate is off the hook. Served with rice, salad and warm pita bread.

Especially when your food is pricey. I've read so many similar reviews like mine, so none of this comes as a shock. <br/><br/>&amp; of course the owner angrily responds over what ? The free baklava  of course that would be the only thing he got from this review. You have TERRIBLE customer service and need to humble yourself. People are spending a lot of money on your food.

I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. <br/><br/>One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. <br/><br/>Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.<br/><br/>Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. <br/><br/>But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.</span></p>,\n",

There are pictures on the walls with some of their items. We ordered the sultan's plate for dinner. It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place. There are not many places that make me drive to Santa Ana, but I'm telling you, this one is worth it.</span></p>,\n",

I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up! All in all, if you decide to give this place a try you won't regret one bite.</span></p>,\n",

It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. <br/><br/>Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be.  <br/><br/>Would definitely recommend. <br/><br/>Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's  not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.<br/><br/>This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute.

Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.<br/><br/>The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. <br/><br/>I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...<br/><br/>Well, there was one bite...<br/><br/>Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. <br/><br/>The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.</span></p>,\n",

I earmarked the spot as I planned my path through the different zones on the provided map and calculated the cost per ticket for the right balance of cuisines and cocktails. Damn right I needed a drink!<br/><br/>Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!<br/><br/>Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!</span></p>,\n",

Usually not a good thing to do as the pickings can be slim and the quality unknown. Boy we're we wrong. It's very rare the food actually looks like the pictures some places post. Being from out of town, we looked at all the Greek places on Yelp and decided to gave them a try. What a treat. The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes,  loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. <br/><br/>The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted.

The ambiance of this location is amazing and very peaceful. The music was a bit too loud at times . As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.</span></p>,\n",

Woman at the register was unfriendly,uncommunicative and barely spoke. When I asked for a cup of water she pointed to the bottle waters in the cooler. When I said no and I again asked for a cup of water she pointed to a water dispenser on the counter. Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. <br/><br/>Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture.

It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. <br/><br/>The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food!

Everything was perfect, from the rice to the succulent pieces of marinated salmon. The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant. All that was missing was a nice glass of wine. They don't have their alcohol license yet, but I understand they are working on it.

There's counter seating along the wall, and 4 or 5 tables for 2 or 4 people along the other wall, and a few tables outside.  I wasn't too happy you have to crane your neck to read the menu posted above the order counter.  Yes, its big but it's also 10 feet above you.<br/><br/>There's no \"lunch specials\" here, or combos like a chicken and a beef plate, or a soup and salad combo. We decided on the recommended Chicken Kebob.  My coworker Anna had it with rice only, while I had the rice and salad combo for the same price.<br/><br/>While we waited, we received a basket of hot. freshly grilled pita bread.  We were fortunate that we were the first one there, so our food didn't take long.  While we were eating, the place got filled up pretty fast.<br/><br/>The only difference between my chicken plate and Anna's rice only plate is Anna got an extra tomato and no salad, while I got a bowl of salad but heavy on the vinaigrette dressing. Very tart and sour!  If you want a salad, ask for the dressing on the side.<br/><br/>My chicken plate with a canned soda (only a buck, cheaper than a fountain drink) came to $14 and change after tax.  I gave $15 and told them to keep the change.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad.  I've had better Persian/ Middle Eastern food. The chicken had good flavor but a bit dry.  The portion is adequate for lunch, but for $12, I'd rather go to Panini Grill at the MainPlace Mall for more.<br/><br/>I'd come back if I didn't want to drive my car, as its only 2 blocks from my office.</span></p>,\n",

Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. <br/><br/>Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant.  <br/><br/>Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. <br/><br/>However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.<br/><br/>Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.<br/><br/>Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.</span></p>,\n",

Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. <br/><br/>A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. <br/><br/>We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. <br/><br/>Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!</span></p>,\n",

My boyfriend was a bit skeptical about it (he doesn't really like trying new places/food) but He ended up loving it. We tried the chicken kabob plate as well as the sultan platter. Everything was very tasty, amazing flavor and great texture. Not to mention the garlic and cilantro sauce. Customer service was a plus, and the atmosphere was great! We will definitely be coming back!</span></p>,\n",

The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. <br/><br/>We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. <br/><br/>Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. <br/><br/>Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. <br/>No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. <br/><br/>Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.</span></p>,\n",

No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. <br/><br/>2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. <br/><br/>3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. <br/><br/>What a terrible experience.

But that was all.<br/>Totally a rip off, I won't go back.</span></p>,\n",

We ended up ordering the gyro beef plate and falafel plate. <br/>The falafel plate was very flavorful. Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. <br/>The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalapeño cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice.

It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. <br/><br/>Appetizer:<br/>I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. <br/><br/>Main:<br/>I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice. <br/><br/>Spot is great. Definitely coming back.

I've eaten at so many Mediterranean spots in SoCal, and while I love the general flavor of it all, I have not found a \"go to\" restaurant until I stumbled upon Kebab Place. <br/><br/>My boyfriend and I ordered the special fillet steak wrap, stoner greek fries, and the combo platter. Every meal comes with complimentary pita bread and a cilantro/jalapeno house sauce (both pita and sauce were pure magick). They also gave us complimentary lentil soup which was very hearty as well as tasty. The fillet mignon in the steak wrap was superior. Marinated, tender, excellent portion. The gyro in the stoner greek fries was perhaps the best gyro I've had. It wasn't dry and was very well seasoned. The hummus, babaganouj, and tzatziki dips were all perfection. Dolmades were delish.<br/><br/>I have nothing bad to say about this place. Customer service was great. Food came out quickly, but not too quickly. By the taste of the food, you can tell everything is fresh and dedication and thoughtfulness is flowing through that kitchen. The price, I considered moderate on it's face.

I would have gladly payed for an extra one.  The parking is limited but not impossible to find parking. Bring change there are parking meters. It was easy to find with directions from yelp. And is located right across the street from a Starbucks.  The place is rather small or cozy. I ate outside because it was a bit crowded inside and most tables were taken.

We called back to make sure we weren't disconnected, he sounded very annoyed and said \"yes yes\" then hung up again. We show up to get the food around 8 and the cashier says \"this is the latest we've done a to go order\"... ok? Uhhh.. Sorry? Your hours say open until 9.

We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price).  I said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation. I felt that they didn't give us the correct food and didn't want to rectify the situation.

I came by because I was on jury duty and it had good reviews here on Yelp. I was supremely disappointed. I gave two stars rather than one ONLY because the employees were friendly.<br/><br/>First of all, the place was nearly empty when I got there (I beat the rush), but it still took over 20 minutes to get my food. A rush came in after I sat down; I can't imagine how long they must have been waiting. I did notice that some takeout orders were going out, so maybe that's what slowed them down. Regardless, when you have a limited time for lunch, a 20 minute wait is not great.<br/><br/>Secondly, the food was really weird. I ordered a lamb kebab platter. I got a large oval plate with a HUGE amount of rice (seriously, probably 2X or 3X the amount of rice I'm used to getting at places like this), maybe 4-5oz of meat, two pieces of grilled tomato, one half of a jalapeño, and 4 triangles of pita. Oh, and about a tablespoon of sauce in a small container. The meat tasted reasonably good (maybe a little over-cooked), the pita was ok, and I liked the sauce. But the proportions of everything were way out of whack. I almost laughed when I saw how much rice there was in comparison to vegetables and meat.<br/><br/>I almost never complain about pricing on Yelp because I'm happy to pay for good food (and I think people are way too quick to complain that something is \"overpriced\"). But this is unreasonable enough that I can't in good conscience let is pass without mention. For the aforementioned plate of mostly rice with a little bit of meat, plus a fountain soda (more on that in a moment), I paid just over $18. Plus tip - there's a tip line on the receipt, and I would have felt like a jerk leaving it blank, so make it $21.<br/><br/>Finally, something was really off with the fountain drink. I ordered Diet Coke, and it tasted nothing like Diet Coke. I'm not sure if it was a knockoff brand, or the syrup was expired, or what, but it was NOT Diet Coke. It also had a bit of a \"musty\" taste to it. Maybe just poor quality product, or maybe the equipment wasn't clean? Anyway, I took a few sips and threw it out. I'll also note that the fountain is behind the register, so you can't regulate your own ice/soda ratio or do your own refills (an extremely minor point that wouldn't warrant a mention if it weren't for all the other stuff).<br/><br/>Anyway, maybe I came on an off day and ordered the wrong stuff. I don't know what else explains all of the very positive reviews of this place. Believe it or not, I'm a pretty positive person, I like most of the places I eat, and I only leave negative reviews on Yelp if I think it's important. In this case, my experience was bad enough, and the other reviews so out of sync with it, that I feel I HAVE to add some balance.<br/><br/>One other probably irrelevant point I should mention. Last time I was on jury duty, about two years ago, I had an eerily similar experience at a different restaurant in this EXACT SAME location. It was a burger place, it had a bunch of really positive reviews, the wait was long, and the food mediocre. Maybe this location is cursed? Maybe I am? I don't know. All I can say is that next time I have jury duty, I will not eat at whatever restaurant happens to be occupying this storefront. There are plenty of other good places to eat near by.</span></p>,\n",

I was pleasantly surprised to find a very clean, modern spot, with a great Persian/Greek-inspired menu. Lots of delicious options to choose from. The great thing about this place is that although it's casual, the portions are large and the food is mouth watering. Kebab Place even serves up a special \"creamy cilantro\" sauce- absolutely delicious with the hot pita bread served on the side with your dish. I would highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner.

When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. <br/>Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed.

Everything is very clean, there are pictures on the wall in case you're not sure what to get, and the staff is super friendly. Looks like it was remodeled. Fits that modern vibe! Portion sizes are huge for the price, so that's a definite plus for me. More bank for your buck, am I right? As someone with a small stomach, I couldn't finish the entire meal, so I took it home for the next day. Still just as good. \\xa0I got the plate with lamb kebab. So good! Will be coming back to try their chicken kebab plate. They also have a Yelp Check-In offer, so don't forget about that ;)\",\n",
       " 'Just got my predictable angry reply by the owner. I\\'ll keep it short. It\\'s pretty telling that the owner says things like \"I\\'m sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review\". Implying that I\\'m in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it\\'s \"pretend false\" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn\\'t happen and I didn\\'t come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.I\\'m sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. The rest of what you\\'re saying, I\\'ll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of \"Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn\\'t be allowed to review!\". That\\'s not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. I don\\'t really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.Of course there is deception, if you\\'re saying \"Salad or rice\" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying \"Fries ok with the wrap?\", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren\\'t going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It\\'s smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it\\'s taxes and such), they don\\'t find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.Yes, it\\'s worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you \"You don\\'t have normal water outside of these bottles?\" to which you replied \"No, sorry\". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?I\\'ll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it\\'s pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using \\'cost-effective\\' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I\\'ll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.I note you said the reason that you didn\\'t offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I\\'ll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don\\'t like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner\\'s responses to other negative responses. \\xa0All are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don\\'t enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don\\'t talk about your experience if you didn\\'t pay in your party, it doesn\\'t count apparently!Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.',\n",

The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.',\n",

       " 'Just got my predictable angry reply by the owner. I\\'ll keep it short. It\\'s pretty telling that the owner says things like \"I\\'m sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review\". Implying that I\\'m in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it\\'s \"pretend false\" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn\\'t happen and I didn\\'t come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.I\\'m sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. The rest of what you\\'re saying, I\\'ll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of \"Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn\\'t be allowed to review!\". That\\'s not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. I don\\'t really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.Of course there is deception, if you\\'re saying \"Salad or rice\" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying \"Fries ok with the wrap?\", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren\\'t going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It\\'s smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it\\'s taxes and such), they don\\'t find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.Yes, it\\'s worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you \"You don\\'t have normal water outside of these bottles?\" to which you replied \"No, sorry\". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?I\\'ll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it\\'s pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using \\'cost-effective\\' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I\\'ll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.I note you said the reason that you didn\\'t offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I\\'ll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don\\'t like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner\\'s responses to other negative responses. \\xa0All are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don\\'t enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don\\'t talk about your experience if you didn\\'t pay in your party, it doesn\\'t count apparently!Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.',\n",

The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws.

One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming.

You can taste the freshness of the salmon in every single bite, not frozen for sure I know my salmon pretty well, it has such a delicious and delicate taste, the spices on it really compliments the entire dish. Now onto the chicken, it's always super moist and delicious, definitely recommend the chicken kebab plate along with the basmati rice and their delicious salad. Last but not least the PITA bread!!!! Oh my goodness it's so soft, and fluffy and the green dip.....!!!!! Makes you literally want to feed off of it and bathe in it lol!!!! This place beats the Panini Grill at the Mainplace mall by a country mile! Literally! You can NOT compare the two this place knocks it our of the park every single time! The portions are generous and always so delicious.\",\n",
       " 'Outstanding! Fresh, hot, flavorful, moist! What else can you ask for with grilled meats. Hummus and babaganoush taste great too. This place does an awesome job and we drive specifically to this place from Irvine for Kebabs. We have eaten in the restaurant and also have catered from them. Their catering is the highest standard in Mediterranean food! I would def recommend hiring them for your next event.',\n",

The Owner was Super Nice & polite, & so Welcoming tooPlanning to go back Soon with friends for Our Gender Reveal gathering',\n",
       " 'First time here and ordered the Mediterranean sample platter. It was the perfect amount for two averagely hungry people. The green sauce and garlic sauce that comes with the pita is addicting. The manager, Rok, was really hospitable and you could definitely tell he was passionate about his food. Would recommend.',\n",
       " 'This was my first time trying this place out and it did NOT disappoint. I ordered the chicken kabob plate and they gave me the option of all rice, or half rice half salad. I chose the half salad and half rice. Our plate was also served with cut up pita bread served with some green cilantro sauce that was divine. The chicken kabob was moist and delicious with the right seasoning. The rice was simple, yet tasty. And the salad was served with some sort of balsamic dressing and it was good. I have to say I left this place feeling stuffed, yet satisfied. Not to mention the quality in the taste of the food was exceptional.',\n",
       " 'Went to eat here to try Mediterranean food for the first time. It was amazing! Silvia was our waitress she was super polite and energetic! She knew we hadnt tried Mediterranean food before so she made some suggestions. We ended up getting the sultan platter to try 3 types of meat. As she suggested and it was amazing the chicken and salmon were mu favorite! Thanks silvia!',\n",

       " \"Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up! All in all, if you decide to give this place a try you won't regret one bite.\",\n",
       " \"We ordered catering and it was fantastic! Chicken was tender and Gyros was yummy. As close to my mother's cooking as I can find. We ordered catering from other Kebab places but my family liked this Kebab the best. We actually did a side by side comparison with our usual catering place and my sons and husband still liked this place way better. Thanks Rok for help with the order.\",\n",
       " 'Presentation was good and they have fast service. Their Kufta is really bad ! It tastes like charcoal Chicken is alright - garlic tastes nothing like garlic sauce. Gyro was little salty. Rice was good Salad was good Fries was good It is a bit expensive yet they give a lot of food.',\n",
       " \"We were looking to have dinner one night and stumbled across their Yelp page and decided to try it out. We weren't too sure on what to expect once we pulled up since it was a small store and everything around it was closed already, but the owner (I think) was really nice and helped us order up front. He also took time to review the items when he dropped it off and chatted with us for a bit. Their house made cilantro dip is to die for! We ordered the Sultan platter which had 3 skewers and we opted for half rice and half salad and also got their waffle fries. In hindsight we could've went without the fries, but everything was SO GOOD! My husband could not stop talking about how good it all was. We are so happy to have found this gem and will definitely be back again!\",\n",
       " 'Great ambiance! The owner is invested in his business and the community, and has been steadily upgrading the restaurant. The food is delicious - freshly made and consistent.I tend to go for the salads, and they are excellent. My current favorite is the falafel salad. I highly recommend Kebab Place for lunch or dinner if you are in the downtown Santa Ana area.',\n",
       " \"Visited on Friday evening with some friends, and had a great experience! Ordered the organic chicken kebab Platter with Rice and it was delicious. I strongly recommend this place. This restaurant serves the best Mediterranean food in the area, it's always fresh and the service is great! The owner is super attentive and checks on your dining experience and explains the menu. Overall, the food is great and the service and ambiance is wonderful! You have to go try their food if you're in the area.\",\n",
       " \"First of all I don't even know how this place got bad reviews. I would come here again based off on the customer service alone. Rok runs the restaurant and has a fantastically friendly attitude. \\xa0My hunch is that he was probably the man who taught chick-fil-a there customer service skills! Lol Aside from the amazing customer service, the food was great. I eat Mediterranean food a few times a week and always make it a point to try new spots and I am very glad I came. Looks like this will be added to the rotationI ordered the combo kebab, chicken and steak with half rice and salad. It also came with complimentary warm pita and a tasty dipping sauce. The meats were well seasoned and grilled to perfection. Everything was tender, fresh, and aromatic. You could tell they put a lot of TLC into there food. Overall no complaints here! Now What are you waiting for go try it! Thank you Rok!\",\n",

       " \"I was so excited to try this place after reading some reviews- I love Mediterranean Food!!! I am a bit disappointed- maybe I got a bad batch of steak? It was really dry and I couldn't chew it. I live close to DTSA and this is the closest to me. Thinking about giving it another try.\",\n",

       " \"The sultan platter is a must!! It's got a mix of kebab meats, grilled veggies, rice and salad. I had lamb, koobideh (ground beef) and the chicken kebab and man was I pleasantly surprised. The seasoning from the meat to the salad and the sauces were really on point. I usually don't care for rice but this was buttery infused with saffron. Yum! Staff are super friendly, they're truly here because they want to be. I highly recommend stopping by if your in the downtown Santa Ana neighborhood. I can't wait to come back for more. Thanks guys!\",\n",
       " \"I am not big on Mediterranean food but this place was delicious and prove to me that Mediterranean foods don't have to be bland. It's a bit pricey but worth it the guy at the desk was super attentive and helpful even when the waiter mixed up our plates with somebody else's he fixed it right away. I can only assume it's the owner as a worker wouldn't care that much\",\n",
       " \"The food is good overall, however I consistently have problems when I get my delivery order. They have twice not included my side of hummus even though I paid for it. I get the charges removed later on but I really just wanted some hummus and it kind of puts a damper on my meal. I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat. I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.\",\n",
       " 'This place was delicious!! I am a huge fan of Mediterranean and probably one of the best Ive had. \\xa0The Stoner Gyro fries are scrumptious. And \\xa0the sultan platter was top notch. I highly recommend this place.',\n",
       " \"Everything was so fucking delicious! \\xa0I hardly leave reviews but this was beyond tasty from the juicy meats to creamy dipping sauces. The basmati rice was so moist. I highly recommend trying this food whether you share a plate or get your own bc it's so bomb! We even met the chef which adds his Mexican touch to everything so you know it's gonna to be well seasoned! I'm most definitely going to keep going!\",\n",
       " \"Came in when they had just opened. The workers seemed a little puzzled with multiple orders they had from a big party. After that was completed the customer service was a lot better!The food.... amazing. It was the best meat the best salad I've had in a long time. This place has fresh food that tastes great! \\xa0Can't wait to be back!\",\n",
       " \"Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be. \\xa0Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's \\xa0not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.\",\n",
       " 'You can taste the quality in their food. I ordered the platter and I must say it is enough food for two to share. I opted for no rice this time. The wait for food is a little long. But, it is cooked to order and super fresh. If you are in a lunch rush, you may want to order ahead. \\xa0I can see myself becoming a regular here. :)',\n",
       " \"Walking into the restaurant there is a Zen vibe and you are greeted by the friendly and attentive staff. \\xa0The food selections are amazing, we treated ourselves to the Sultan platter which was a combination of lamb steak ground beef Shawarma and salmon with dill seasoning it was also accompanied by basmati rice and Mediterranean salad which was unbelievable. \\xa0The meats were perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of flavor and seasoning; the portions were very generous with a very nice presentation. \\xa0I'd highly recommend this to friends and family for dine in or take out.\",\n",
       " 'Taste: 5/5 however they charge for water, and they made it seem like I had an option of half salad half rice then charged me $2 for it. In the end i spent $36.48 for a cup of water and one sultan platter which seems a bit much for being two dollar signs.',\n",
       " \"This is my first time here and it was delicious!! The service was great! Portion size was great for price!I got the Sultan platter and all meats were delicious and savory and juicy!!! The cilantro sauce with the warm pita bread was by far some of the best pita and sauce I've tried! I can not recommend this place enough! Only thing I would recommend is I went with my sister in law who is vegan she ordered the falafel salad that she enjoyed a lot but felt that they could've done a better job at promoting their vegan options! But they did offer to put a veggie patty into a Gyro for her which was great! All in all five star for sure!!\",\n",

       " \"Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.\",\n",

Damn right I needed a drink!Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!\",\n",

The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes, \\xa0loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted. I will gladly pay a few dollars more to get the quality of food that Rok served us tonight.

As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.\",\n",

Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture.

It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food!

The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant.

There\\'s counter seating along the wall, and 4 or 5 tables for 2 or 4 people along the other wall, and a few tables outside. \\xa0I wasn\\'t too happy you have to crane your neck to read the menu posted above the order counter. \\xa0Yes, its big but it\\'s also 10 feet above you.There\\'s no \"lunch specials\" here, or combos like a chicken and a beef plate, or a soup and salad combo. We decided on the recommended Chicken Kebob. \\xa0My coworker Anna had it with rice only, while I had the rice and salad combo for the same price.While we waited, we received a basket of hot. freshly grilled pita bread. \\xa0We were fortunate that we were the first one there, so our food didn\\'t take long. \\xa0While we were eating, the place got filled up pretty fast.The only difference between my chicken plate and Anna\\'s rice only plate is Anna got an extra tomato and no salad, while I got a bowl of salad but heavy on the vinaigrette dressing. Very tart and sour! \\xa0If you want a salad, ask for the dressing on the side.My chicken plate with a canned soda (only a buck, cheaper than a fountain drink) came to $14 and change after tax. \\xa0I gave $15 and told them to keep the change.Overall, not bad. \\xa0I\\'ve had better Persian/ Middle Eastern food. The chicken had good flavor but a bit dry. \\xa0The portion is adequate for lunch, but for $12, I\\'d rather go to Panini Grill at the MainPlace Mall for more.I\\'d come back if I didn\\'t want to drive my car, as its only 2 blocks from my office.',\n",

Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.',\n",

Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community.

Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.\",\n",

Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food.

We discussed the business and the menu and I decided to order the Mediterranean burger so that I could provide an honest Yelp review. The burger was very tasty/juicy and I was given a slice of baklava upon finsihing my meal.The gang at kebab place spoke a big game and needless to say the bakalava was without a doubt some of the best I've ever eaten.

No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience.

Every meal comes with complimentary pita bread and a cilantro/jalapeno house sauce (both pita and sauce were pure magick). They also gave us complimentary lentil soup which was very hearty as well as tasty. The fillet mignon in the steak wrap was superior. Marinated, tender, excellent portion.

Dolmades were delish.I have nothing bad to say about this place. Customer service was great. Food came out quickly, but not too quickly. By the taste of the food, you can tell everything is fresh and dedication and thoughtfulness is flowing through that kitchen. The price, I considered moderate on it\\'s face.

       " 'I don\\'t know what the deal is with this place. I came by because I was on jury duty and it had good reviews here on Yelp. I was supremely disappointed. I gave two stars rather than one ONLY because the employees were friendly.First of all, the place was nearly empty when I got there (I beat the rush), but it still took over 20 minutes to get my food. A rush came in after I sat down; I can\\'t imagine how long they must have been waiting. I did notice that some takeout orders were going out, so maybe that\\'s what slowed them down. Regardless, when you have a limited time for lunch, a 20 minute wait is not great.Secondly, the food was really weird. I ordered a lamb kebab platter. I got a large oval plate with a HUGE amount of rice (seriously, probably 2X or 3X the amount of rice I\\'m used to getting at places like this), maybe 4-5oz of meat, two pieces of grilled tomato, one half of a jalapeño, and 4 triangles of pita. Oh, and about a tablespoon of sauce in a small container. The meat tasted reasonably good (maybe a little over-cooked), the pita was ok, and I liked the sauce. But the proportions of everything were way out of whack. I almost laughed when I saw how much rice there was in comparison to vegetables and meat.I almost never complain about pricing on Yelp because I\\'m happy to pay for good food (and I think people are way too quick to complain that something is \"overpriced\"). But this is unreasonable enough that I can\\'t in good conscience let is pass without mention. For the aforementioned plate of mostly rice with a little bit of meat, plus a fountain soda (more on that in a moment), I paid just over $18. Plus tip - there\\'s a tip line on the receipt, and I would have felt like a jerk leaving it blank, so make it $21.Finally, something was really off with the fountain drink. I ordered Diet Coke, and it tasted nothing like Diet Coke. I\\'m not sure if it was a knockoff brand, or the syrup was expired, or what, but it was NOT Diet Coke. It also had a bit of a \"musty\" taste to it. Maybe just poor quality product, or maybe the equipment wasn\\'t clean? Anyway, I took a few sips and threw it out. I\\'ll also note that the fountain is behind the register, so you can\\'t regulate your own ice/soda ratio or do your own refills (an extremely minor point that wouldn\\'t warrant a mention if it weren\\'t for all the other stuff).Anyway, maybe I came on an off day and ordered the wrong stuff. I don\\'t know what else explains all of the very positive reviews of this place. Believe it or not, I\\'m a pretty positive person, I like most of the places I eat, and I only leave negative reviews on Yelp if I think it\\'s important. In this case, my experience was bad enough, and the other reviews so out of sync with it, that I feel I HAVE to add some balance.One other probably irrelevant point I should mention. Last time I was on jury duty, about two years ago, I had an eerily similar experience at a different restaurant in this EXACT SAME location. It was a burger place, it had a bunch of really positive reviews, the wait was long, and the food mediocre. Maybe this location is cursed? Maybe I am? I don\\'t know. All I can say is that next time I have jury duty, I will not eat at whatever restaurant happens to be occupying this storefront. There are plenty of other good places to eat near by.',\n",

They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed.

Portion sizes are huge for the price, so that's a definite plus for me. More bank for your buck, am I right? As someone with a small stomach, I couldn't finish the entire meal, so I took it home for the next day. Still just as good.  I got the plate with lamb kebab. So good!

      "Just got my predictable angry reply by the owner. I'll keep it short. It's pretty telling that the owner says things like \"I'm sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review\". Implying that I'm in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it's \"pretend false\" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn't happen and I didn't come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.I'm sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. The rest of what you're saying, I'll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of \"Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn't be allowed to review!\". That's not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. I don't really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.Of course there is deception, if you're saying \"Salad or rice\" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying \"Fries ok with the wrap?\", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren't going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It's smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it's taxes and such), they don't find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.Yes, it's worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you \"You don't have normal water outside of these bottles?\" to which you replied \"No, sorry\". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?I'll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it's pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using 'cost-effective' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I'll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.I note you said the reason that you didn't offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I'll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don't like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner's responses to other negative responses.  All are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don't enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don't talk about your experience if you didn't pay in your party, it doesn't count apparently!Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.\n",

My father in law is new to keto and asked us to find somewhere we could go to lunch that is keto friendly and I'm so glad we found kebab place! We ordered the keto platter and everything was amazing. Everything tasted extremely fresh with great flavor. We also ordered the salmon kebab/Greek salad. It was all delicious and we will definitely be back. It is hard to find places to go out to eat that serve truly keto dishes that also taste good and this place is a win! The service was also amazing and loved the ambiance of the place.

      "Service was good, food is great. I ordered the Sultan platter which came with three kebabs: chicken, ground sirloin, and my choice of lamb. All meats were good and flavorful. The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.\n",

Portion sizes are huge for the price, so that's a definite plus for me. More bank for your buck, am I right? As someone with a small stomach, I couldn't finish the entire meal, so I took it home for the next day. Still just as good.  I got the plate with lamb kebab. So good!

      "Just got my predictable angry reply by the owner. I'll keep it short. It's pretty telling that the owner says things like \"I'm sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review\". Implying that I'm in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it's \"pretend false\" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn't happen and I didn't come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.I'm sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. The rest of what you're saying, I'll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of \"Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn't be allowed to review!\". That's not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. I don't really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.Of course there is deception, if you're saying \"Salad or rice\" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying \"Fries ok with the wrap?\", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren't going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It's smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it's taxes and such), they don't find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.Yes, it's worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you \"You don't have normal water outside of these bottles?\" to which you replied \"No, sorry\". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?I'll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it's pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using 'cost-effective' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I'll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.I note you said the reason that you didn't offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I'll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don't like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner's responses to other negative responses.  All are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don't enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don't talk about your experience if you didn't pay in your party, it doesn't count apparently!Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.\n",

      "Now that this location was shut down for a Rodent infestation I will no longer be coming to this location. I don't understand how a restaurant could allow themselves to get that disgusting. Don't you disinfect and sanitize the entire kitchen? Obviously not if the city has to come shut the establishment down because of such unhealthy working environment. Unfortunately the owner of the company the more mature lady was always rude and angry when approached. I try to make an order and she gave me a look of disgust. Make she wonder if you really value this restaurant or not. If I was a restaurant business owner I would take customer service 100% to the next level. Without customers there's no business.\n",

      "The food is great. The owner is rude and it's VERY clear that he's cheap. Which is why I'm giving two stars. I ate here a few times and the last time I went, the owner made a big deal over the tiniest CUBE of baklava that I asked for since you get one for free when you check in. He snarked \"you have to eat here! That's the whole point.\" Um ok? It was disgusting anyway. I decided not to come back. I will not support businesses that have terrible service. Especially when your food is pricey. I've read so many similar reviews like mine, so none of this comes as a shock. & of course the owner angrily responds over what ? The free baklava  of course that would be the only thing he got from this review. You have TERRIBLE customer service and need to humble yourself. People are spending a lot of money on your food. How petty is it to get upset over a cube of baklava. How about a \"hey thank you for ordering from us, here you go.\" How about a \"we have some tables open if you would like to stay and dine in.\" I wasn't exploiting any offer. Because I STAYED and ate at the tables outside. But you were so quick to jump down my throat because I ordered online. I planned on eating there. WORK ON YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!

      "Agree with Daniel Z.'s review revealing that they are *very* deceitful. It just gives me a bad feeling about the ownership and I prefer to support businesses that are ethical, honest, and customer-oriented rather than ones that engage in tactics to be sneaky about nickel-and-diming or price gouging customers. Makes me wonder what shortcuts they are taking with food/ingredients to penny pinch. I ordered a gyro wrap, and it came complete with surprise extra charges for offered sauces and fries which were pictured on the menu *with* the wrap and the listed price for a wrap; and, when I ordered, he simply said, \"fries ok for the wrap?\" instead of asking me, \"Do you want to add fries for $4\" or whatever. He also offered me the choice of a sauce from a list of I believe 3, never letting me know that it'd be another couple of extra dollars if I made a selection lol. Ended up doubling what I thought I was paying for a quick lunch, and I didn't really enjoy the meal itself. Beware guys--I won't be back.\n",

      "Food was delicious. I got a sampler platter, pictured here. My only complaints, and my only reasons for not giving five stars, are as follows. One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.\n",

      "Mediterranean cravings brought me to this place. There are pictures on the walls with some of their items. We ordered the sultan's plate for dinner. It came with 3 proteins: gyro meat (lamb and beef), beef, chicken, and rice (which you can order just 1/2 and the other 1/2 you can make into a salad). Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place.

      "Just moved my best friend to this area and we were looking for a place to have a nice meal after all that moving. I've been keto since the first of this month and needed to find a place that was keto friendly. We did some digging on Yelp and saw that Kebab Place had a Keto Plate so we decided to check it out. My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up! All in all, if you decide to give this place a try you won't regret one bite.\n",

      "We ordered catering and it was fantastic! Chicken was tender and Gyros was yummy. As close to my mother's cooking as I can find. We ordered catering from other Kebab places but my family liked this Kebab the best. We actually did a side by side comparison with our usual catering place and my sons and husband still liked this place way better. Thanks Rok for help with the order.\n",

      "We were looking to have dinner one night and stumbled across their Yelp page and decided to try it out. We weren't too sure on what to expect once we pulled up since it was a small store and everything around it was closed already, but the owner (I think) was really nice and helped us order up front. He also took time to review the items when he dropped it off and chatted with us for a bit. Their house made cilantro dip is to die for! We ordered the Sultan platter which had 3 skewers and we opted for half rice and half salad and also got their waffle fries. In hindsight we could've went without the fries, but everything was SO GOOD! My husband could not stop talking about how good it all was. We are so happy to have found this gem and will definitely be back again!\n",

      "First of all I don't even know how this place got bad reviews. I would come here again based off on the customer service alone. Rok runs the restaurant and has a fantastically friendly attitude.  My hunch is that he was probably the man who taught chick-fil-a there customer service skills! Lol Aside from the amazing customer service, the food was great. I eat Mediterranean food a few times a week and always make it a point to try new spots and I am very glad I came. Looks like this will be added to the rotationI ordered the combo kebab, chicken and steak with half rice and salad. It also came with complimentary warm pita and a tasty dipping sauce. The meats were well seasoned and grilled to perfection. Everything was tender, fresh, and aromatic. You could tell they put a lot of TLC into there food. Overall no complaints here!

      "The food is good overall, however I consistently have problems when I get my delivery order. They have twice not included my side of hummus even though I paid for it. I get the charges removed later on but I really just wanted some hummus and it kind of puts a damper on my meal. I could just drive to pick it up and make sure the hummus is there but I really shouldn't have to. The breakfast gyro wrap was really weird. It is advertised with bell peppers and hash browns but instead comes with a few fries, thousand island, and tomato and cucumber that are slightly cooked and soggy. If you come here just stick to the Kebabs. I do really like their salmon, chicken, and gyro meat. I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.\n",

      "Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be.  Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's  not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.\n",

      "Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.\n",

      "I would never have found this great Persian kabob place if not for the 2017 rendition of Savor Santa Ana. I earmarked the spot as I planned my path through the different zones on the provided map and calculated the cost per ticket for the right balance of cuisines and cocktails. Damn right I needed a drink!Anyhow, by the time I arrived here they were slammed. As the evening progressed it got steadily busier everywhere. Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had. Not too salty either!Because I found several places worth visiting again in old Santa Ana, I'm plotting my return to Kabob Place. Bravi!\n",

      "Unbelievable all around. No kidding - it was AMAZING. The seating area is so unique with the murals on the walls, the cool light fixtures, the large tv screens, the mood lighting. We walked into an experience. The service was absolutely phenomenal: checking in on us, quick to respond, friendly, sincere. And when we got our food, we were stunned at how much better this is compared to other gyro places we have been. By far, this place is my favorite for gyro! We will be back. It's saved to my collection of favorite restaurants. Well done, Kebab Place.\n",

Today We had the Sultan plater which consists of chicken Kebab, steak Kebab and grilled Salmon, we also added Koobide and Gyro with Mediteranian salad and rice.

It's very rare the food actually looks like the pictures some places post. Being from out of town, we looked at all the Greek places on Yelp and decided to gave them a try. What a treat. The owner, Rok, was amazing from the start, explaining the menu and choices for each meal and really pleasant to talk to. We ordered the Sultan Plate, as I wanted to try a variety of the meats. We also got the regular Gyro platter. The Salmon was absolutely amazing, hot, tender and delicious. The koobideh and the chicken were equally as good and we were amazed that each stayed moist throughout the meal, and yes,  loaded with flavor. The Gyro plate was excellent with plenty of meat. The green sauce they serve tops off what we found to be some of the best Greek food we have tasted. I will gladly pay a few dollars more to get the quality of food that Rok served us tonight.

As soon as I entered the cashier guy was on the laptop and he wasn't very welcoming . I just came for the food so it didn't bother me . I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience . I'm just saying but how are you going to give an attitude when I ask if you sell the yogurt drink. It ain't that deep.\n",

      "Service-poor.  I was the only one in line and it still took almost 10 minutes to place my order. Woman at the register was unfriendly,uncommunicative and barely spoke. When I asked for a cup of water she pointed to the bottle waters in the cooler. When I said no and I again asked for a cup of water she pointed to a water dispenser on the counter. Waited over 10 minutes for a Gyro pita that should have taken 5 minutes at most. When the same woman delivered my food, I thanked her but got no response. Food-poor. Gyro pita wrap was dry and bland. No tzatziki sauce which is the core of a pita sandwich and gives it flavor and moisture. Gyro portion was ok but the wrap was overwhelmed by lettuce Price- poor $9.95 for my disappointing lunch of a gyro pita sandwich and no sides. Recommendation - don't go.  Go to Crave down the street for a great sandwich,soup and/or salad\n",

      "Chicken kebab wrap! The staff is so nice and friendly but the food was a-okay. I got the wrap and ate it only 5 minutes after I received it. However, it was incredibly soggy already as the juices from the meat had permeated the wrapping. At the end, I was eating a bite of the wrap with a fork while trying to get pieces of meat and tomato with my hands. Everything was torn up and dripping. It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food! You would not run into the problem I ran into with the plates, but insofar as I ate the wrap, I have nothing more to say!\n",

      "Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch.  Everything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable.  So having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go.  It took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?).  I took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside.  The sauces provided were fresh and tasty.  So I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office.  The ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line.  I walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap.  I got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops.  I won't make that mistake again.  Not that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious!  Chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  I could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is.  I thought the portion size was perfect and the service was friendly and the food was very flavorful.  Some people just can't be pleased with anything.\n",

I had the salmon kebab and I couldn't have been happier. Everything was perfect, from the rice to the succulent pieces of marinated salmon. The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant. All that was missing was a nice glass of wine. They don't have their alcohol license yet, but I understand they are working on it. Im picky about my food and I have to say my tummy was happy and satisfied well after we had gone. I highly recommend this restaurant! Please tell Roc I sent you!\n",

      "3 1/2 stars for this visit.  My original lunch plans was to try the new Irenia located next to the Rags newspaper stand, but apparently they don't bother to post on the door they're NOT open for lunch on Tuesdays.  So we walked around the corner and spied Kebab Place, located across the street from Starbucks.  They advertised their \"highly recommended\" chicken kebab plate for $11.99.The place is tiny and narrow. There's counter seating along the wall, and 4 or 5 tables for 2 or 4 people along the other wall, and a few tables outside.  I wasn't too happy you have to crane your neck to read the menu posted above the order counter.  Yes, its big but it's also 10 feet above you.There's no \"lunch specials\" here, or combos like a chicken and a beef plate, or a soup and salad combo. We decided on the recommended Chicken Kebob.  My coworker Anna had it with rice only, while I had the rice and salad combo for the same price.While we waited, we received a basket of hot. freshly grilled pita bread.  We were fortunate that we were the first one there, so our food didn't take long.  While we were eating, the place got filled up pretty fast.The only difference between my chicken plate and Anna's rice only plate is Anna got an extra tomato and no salad, while I got a bowl of salad but heavy on the vinaigrette dressing. Very tart and sour!  If you want a salad, ask for the dressing on the side.My chicken plate with a canned soda (only a buck, cheaper than a fountain drink) came to $14 and change after tax.  I gave $15 and told them to keep the change.Overall, not bad.  I've had better Persian/ Middle Eastern food. The chicken had good flavor but a bit dry.  The portion is adequate for lunch, but for $12, I'd rather go to Panini Grill at the MainPlace Mall for more.I'd come back if I didn't want to drive my car, as its only 2 blocks from my office.\n",

      "Came here on a slow weekday for takeout when I was passing by the block. Upon entering I was greeted by a gentleman at the cashier and placed my order. Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant.  Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.\n",

The food is delicious and they make it as you order. Everything is fresh is rare to find places like this. Everything is fresh and delicious!!If you don't want to wait you can also order online or call. If you don't know what order get the kebab platter it has 3 types of meats. My favorite is the chicken kebab . Stop by today or order online they deliver too. You won't be disappointed.\n",

      "Well here it is the big 400, does it really matter? Or does it mean I have to much time on my hands? Nonsense lets talk about this awesome little gem in DTSA. Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!\n",

      "This is the first restaurant I have tried in downtown Santa Ana and was on the ok side. The place is good for a quick Mediterranean snack if in the neighborhood. I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.\n",

The food was really delicious! we got lucky and snagged a table outside on a beautiful sunny day. we chatted, laughed, gossiped, and nibbled on our food. would absolutely come back again!\n",

Rok,the owner,helped us decide what to order. We had a platter that had three proteins (organic chicken, steak, and ground beef), rice, and several sauces. Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food.

      "This is for my experience with ordering delivery through Yelp. Here are the reasons why I am giving this place 1 star:1) I placed the order a little after 12 pm for 3 items. food was to be delivered at 1:12 pm, at :1:20 pm I called to get an update and the lady that answers the phone abruptly tells me the driver is on the way. No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience. I was not given the impression that the restaurant wanted to make things right with me as I have a valid reason to be upset. I'm sitting here writing this email hangry btw.\n",

When I tried to order in person what I had ordered thru doordash one week prior, he told me their system was different and that he'd have to charge me for two separate kabobs which came out to $5 extra.. so $20 for one plate! The right thing to do from a customer service standpoint would've been to honor that price shown online. Very disappointing. Won't bother going there again.\n",

My husband And I both had the Kevin plate which came with your choice of meat, grilled veggies an option for half salad and half rice. Pitta bread with a side dipping sauce was also provided. The food was fresh and flavorful! The portion size is large and fulfilling. We are already planning to try the grilled salmon kebob next time.  If your not in the mood for kebobs, they also have burgers and gyros with fries. The customer service is warm and friendly, with family owned vibes. This a great spot to eat and then take a stroll through downtown afterwards.\n",

That is the first issue. I had to eat fast to get back in time.The second issue was the price. 20 bucks for one lamb kebob, rice, and really really bad babaganooj. Like the worst I have ever had, that bad. It didn't even have the right texture or taste like eggplant. That brings me to the food. The two stars are because at least the lamb was tasty.

The food was delicious (I got the gyro platter) and the man that worked there was super nice. You order at the counter and then take a seat, but instead of just calling our names out and giving us our food, he took care of it and stopped by often to refill our water and take away our finished plates. The platter comes with a salad and rice, and my friend got the falafel platter which came with fries (and I love fries). It was empty when we came in, probably because this place delivers and I assume most people just get to-go, but it's very nice place that I'm glad I was able to come across.\n",

It's a small little spot with one sign out front so might be easy to miss driving by. We ended up ordering the gyro beef plate and falafel plate. The falafel plate was very flavorful. Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalapeño cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice.

It has a warm atmosphere and the menu is super easy to read with a lot of good, traditional Arab dishes. Starter:They hit me with some pita bread and their house sauce. It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice. Spot is great. Definitely coming back. The guys here do a top notch job. Supporting small places like this is a must. Try them out.\n",

      "This place is a true diamond in the rough. I've eaten at so many Mediterranean spots in SoCal, and while I love the general flavor of it all, I have not found a \"go to\" restaurant until I stumbled upon Kebab Place. My boyfriend and I ordered the special fillet steak wrap, stoner greek fries, and the combo platter. Every meal comes with complimentary pita bread and a cilantro/jalapeno house sauce (both pita and sauce were pure magick). They also gave us complimentary lentil soup which was very hearty as well as tasty. The fillet mignon in the steak wrap was superior. Marinated, tender, excellent portion. The gyro in the stoner greek fries was perhaps the best gyro I've had. It wasn't dry and was very well seasoned. The hummus, babaganouj, and tzatziki dips were all perfection. Dolmades were delish.I have nothing bad to say about this place. Customer service was great. Food came out quickly, but not too quickly. By the taste of the food, you can tell everything is fresh and dedication and thoughtfulness is flowing through that kitchen. The price, I considered moderate on it's face. But once you taste the quality of their meals, it is a bargain for this kind of fresh, well made meal.Any time I am near Main and 4th, I'm stopping by!\n",

I would have gladly payed for an extra one.  The parking is limited but not impossible to find parking. Bring change there are parking meters. It was easy to find with directions from yelp. And is located right across the street from a Starbucks.  The place is rather small or cozy. I ate outside because it was a bit crowded inside and most tables were taken. But that's not a bad thing as I enjoyed eating outside. I would recommend this place because of the tasty food. But if you are in a rush y oui u should call your order in. I called my order in and it was cooked fresh in about 15 minutes more or less. I was on lunch break from work so calling ahead to place the order was very convenient.

The staff and their customer service was great. I ordered a lamb Kebab... I typically don't eat meat...but I love how light lamb is. The plate was very big and my lamb kebab was fresh and savory. The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked. I recommend sharing the plates!They have a variety of different things on their menu. I snagged a few menus to take back with me to my studio.

Highly recommend, I wasn't very adventurous and went with my tried and true classic lamb and beef gyro, so much flavor  in the meat, I ate every bite.  Got an appetizer of hummus for the 3 of us, nice amount of tang.  Cherish got the chicken kabob, the spices wee just right, basmati rice very tasty, and lots of it.  Mark had the steak gyro, he said that it was really good too.  I'll be back!!!!\n",

      "Good food but their hours & customer service need improvement. First time we called in an order around 730 pm, guy harriedly said \"OK\" and hung up--no total $, no time, no goodbye. We called back to make sure we weren't disconnected, he sounded very annoyed and said \"yes yes\" then hung up again. We show up to get the food around 8 and the cashier says \"this is the latest we've done a to go order\"... ok? Uhhh.. Sorry? Your hours say open until 9. Whatever, got the food and it is very tasty.Second time we try yo go there, it is 7 pm on a friday night. Closed, locked, not a soul in sight.I understand its a mom and pop that mostly does lunch, but if you are going to close 2 hours early and have an attitude about it, change your signs that very clearly state open until 9!\n",

We ordered online and got a couple Mediterranean Kebab Sampler Platters (online price $13) and one combination platter (online price $15) figuring it was more food for two people to share. When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus. When I called to question why the price was higher for less food, he tried to explain that it depended on which kebabs you picked (but even though we picked the cheapest, it was still going to be the max price).  I said then we should have ordered the steak kebab and he said, well no it was still the same price. He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation. I felt that they didn't give us the correct food and didn't want to rectify the situation. I was disappointed and wish they had priced their food correctly especially since it is so good\n",

      "I don't know what the deal is with this place. I came by because I was on jury duty and it had good reviews here on Yelp. I was supremely disappointed. I gave two stars rather than one ONLY because the employees were friendly.First of all, the place was nearly empty when I got there (I beat the rush), but it still took over 20 minutes to get my food. A rush came in after I sat down; I can't imagine how long they must have been waiting. I did notice that some takeout orders were going out, so maybe that's what slowed them down. Regardless, when you have a limited time for lunch, a 20 minute wait is not great.Secondly, the food was really weird. I ordered a lamb kebab platter. I got a large oval plate with a HUGE amount of rice (seriously, probably 2X or 3X the amount of rice I'm used to getting at places like this), maybe 4-5oz of meat, two pieces of grilled tomato, one half of a jalapeño, and 4 triangles of pita. Oh, and about a tablespoon of sauce in a small container. The meat tasted reasonably good (maybe a little over-cooked), the pita was ok, and I liked the sauce. But the proportions of everything were way out of whack. I almost laughed when I saw how much rice there was in comparison to vegetables and meat.I almost never complain about pricing on Yelp because I'm happy to pay for good food (and I think people are way too quick to complain that something is \"overpriced\"). But this is unreasonable enough that I can't in good conscience let is pass without mention. For the aforementioned plate of mostly rice with a little bit of meat, plus a fountain soda (more on that in a moment), I paid just over $18. Plus tip - there's a tip line on the receipt, and I would have felt like a jerk leaving it blank, so make it $21.Finally, something was really off with the fountain drink. I ordered Diet Coke, and it tasted nothing like Diet Coke. I'm not sure if it was a knockoff brand, or the syrup was expired, or what, but it was NOT Diet Coke. It also had a bit of a \"musty\" taste to it. Maybe just poor quality product, or maybe the equipment wasn't clean? Anyway, I took a few sips and threw it out. I'll also note that the fountain is behind the register, so you can't regulate your own ice/soda ratio or do your own refills (an extremely minor point that wouldn't warrant a mention if it weren't for all the other stuff).Anyway, maybe I came on an off day and ordered the wrong stuff. I don't know what else explains all of the very positive reviews of this place. Believe it or not, I'm a pretty positive person, I like most of the places I eat, and I only leave negative reviews on Yelp if I think it's important. In this case, my experience was bad enough, and the other reviews so out of sync with it, that I feel I HAVE to add some balance.One other probably irrelevant point I should mention. Last time I was on jury duty, about two years ago, I had an eerily similar experience at a different restaurant in this EXACT SAME location. It was a burger place, it had a bunch of really positive reviews, the wait was long, and the food mediocre. Maybe this location is cursed? Maybe I am? I don't know. All I can say is that next time I have jury duty, I will not eat at whatever restaurant happens to be occupying this storefront. There are plenty of other good places to eat near by.\n",

My boyfriend had the steak plate and loved it as well. A tip if you're grabbing your meal to go around lunch time, call ahead! Trust me! The line just to order can take around 20 minutes and then you'll be waiting for your food to be made after that. It's definitely worth the wait though.

      "I recently visited downtown Santa Ana for the first time in over 5 years. The area is quite charming and full of locals and tourists. Kebab Place sits right across the Starbucks, about a block or so from Chapter One (another one of my favorite spots). I was pleasantly surprised to find a very clean, modern spot, with a great Persian/Greek-inspired menu. Lots of delicious options to choose from. The great thing about this place is that although it's casual, the portions are large and the food is mouth watering. Kebab Place even serves up a special \"creamy cilantro\" sauce- absolutely delicious with the hot pita bread served on the side with your dish. I would highly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner. I got a chance to chat with the new owner (Hooman), and he mentioned that they'll start to serve breakfast wraps and sandwiches soon. I think it'll be a great option for the many office buildings and residents around the area. I'll definitely be visiting again very soon!\n",

I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed. It's listed as a must try and it really is a must try dish. I highly recommend this place for delicious fresh made dishes to satisfy many cravings and make sure you try their lentil soup!\n",

       " 'Just got my predictable angry reply by the owner. I\\'ll keep it short. It\\'s pretty telling that the owner says things like \"I\\'m sure you knew I was not just going to let you get away with your pretend false review\". Implying that I\\'m in fact in the wrong for feeling how I did. Saying that it\\'s \"pretend false\" also implies it is fake, as if all of this didn\\'t happen and I didn\\'t come there, but you seem to acknowledge it all did happen.I\\'m sorry yet honored you feel I sound like a seasoned reviewer. I was in California for the summer, although I currently live in Pennsylvania. The rest of what you\\'re saying, I\\'ll blame on perhaps only looking into it almost 3 months later. No, I did not come in with a party of 4, you may be thinking of someone else. I did get a chuckle out of \"Although you ate our food and experienced our service, if someone else in your party paid, you shouldn\\'t be allowed to review!\". That\\'s not really how it works, fortunately! Take heart however, my brother who paid also did review the restaurant similarly. I don\\'t really know how your second point refutes anything. The taking of two tables (this was 2 and a half months ago), I frankly do not remember, but I do remember your store being completely empty, so I apologize if taking an extra table hurt. I also thank you for surprisingly not charging us for that extra table in the empty store, progress is clearly being made with your practices.Of course there is deception, if you\\'re saying \"Salad or rice\" as if they are two options cost the same, or saying \"Fries ok with the wrap?\", as if this is the default. You make it a point to say that this is a counter service, which is absolutely true. But you can still be deceptive at the counter itself, and you likely know that when people spend time deciding about an order, they likely aren\\'t going to undo the whole order over 2-3 dollars. It\\'s smart, but deceptive nonetheless. If you are not informing the buyer that if they choose a certain option, they will pay extra, that is deceptive. You only say the final price at the end, and unless the person asks (if they are not assuming it\\'s taxes and such), they don\\'t find out the reason for the extra pricing until they see their receipt.Yes, it\\'s worrisome regarding the clean water. Mainly because I specifically asked you \"You don\\'t have normal water outside of these bottles?\" to which you replied \"No, sorry\". Should I instead assume you are lying and that there is normal water?I\\'ll let others who read this decide for themselves, but it\\'s pretty embarrassing you are actually trying to justify not offering water to customers, and using \\'cost-effective\\' as your excuse. I will say this though: out of my own kindness, I will personally buy you a water dispenser if cost is truly what is preventing you from doing it. I\\'ll even get one with cups, so there will be very little labor, even less than the labor of processing an order for every water bottle.I note you said the reason that you didn\\'t offer the tap water (admittedly lying when I asked if you have normal water), is because of 4 people with 1 platter who are unwilling to pay for water. Again, we were 3 people, but furthermore, we actually DID order a water bottle! After we ran out of the water, I asked for one because I assumed the bottle itself was just for cold water, which is when you lied and said that you have no water. I\\'ll attach the receipt to save you the embarrassment of lying again.You are absolutely correct that this is my first review, I hope that is telling for how much I believe this needed to be said. Obviously, it has been useful to others considering the votes and similar reviews. On the other hand, your constant insulting and personal attacks are all just because you don\\'t like negative reviews. I encourage readers to look at the owner\\'s responses to other negative responses. \\xa0All are: you are a liar, dishonest, exploitative, abusing elite status, etc. Buyer beware, if you don\\'t enjoy your experience here and say so, you will be attacked by the owner. And don\\'t talk about your experience if you didn\\'t pay in your party, it doesn\\'t count apparently!Thank you for complimenting my writing skills, and let me know if you do need an investment for water dispenser.',\n",

The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.',\n",

It came out to about 63 dollars for our meal but It's so so worth it. Every single bite was so fresh and tasty.

The meat/rice choice I had was mediocre compared to places like Hatams in Anaheim. You also have to buy water. Put a pitcher out with some cups. It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant.

The lamb was cooked well done, very over. The chicken was tender and moist and the ground sirloin was bursting with flavor. The garlic sauce was certainly mayo use based and did not taste like garlic. The mayo was not good mayo either. I would recommend a 50/50 mayo/sour cream mix with fresh minced or crushed garlic. The tzatsiki was very good as well as the cilantro chutney served with the pita bread. Lime is not traditionally Greek, I would have preferred lemon as most Greek and Middle Eastern cuisine would offer. Overall very good, just a few minor technical flaws. The owner took my order and followed up after the food to explain the sauces and check in. Very friendly, very scalable business.',\n",

It doesn't cost much at all but it provides customers with water without having to buy it in a bottle. This is a basic need for a restaurant.

One, this is not a bargain place, as the humble promises may suggest. Even if you assume that this platter will serve two people, you were still talking $10 per person for a walk up /counter service restaurant. Two, as many others have pointed out, you really must order ahead if you want to avoid waiting 20 to 25 minutes at lunchtime. I ordered online 15 minutes before getting to the store, and I still had to wait 10 more minutes after getting there. Not really a negative if you are aware of the issue, but I could see newcomers being put off by it.Three, the amount of pita bread given out as part of the $20 platter is ridiculously small. It's essentially one small circle of pita bread cut into quarters. Sure, they offer additional pita bread, but it is four dollars per order. Nickel and diming. But to reiterate: the food is awesome, fresh, hot and delicious.\",\n",

Let me just start by saying that I'm a fan of zankou chicken and their garlic sauce. Well, this place beats zankou because 1) it's not crazy crowded 2) chicken is moister and 3) they have a great garlic sauce that's just as good as zankou's if not better. I loved the gyro meat. I've never had anything like it (although I've had my fair share of Mediterranean foods). It is so deliciously seasoned and so very tender. You have got to try this place.

My friend ordered the humus and I watched in envy as she loaded humus on delicious slices of fresh pita bread. I snuck a taste of the humus so I can vouch for how delicious it was! I went back in to order another round of sparkling waters and (the owner?) asks me if I was the one on keto which I said yes I was. I said my friend got the humus and I was envious he told me not to worry, he would be fixing me up in just a moment. And holy crap he was right! They brought my salad out first and it was a huge plate of a fresh Greek salad with delicious feta cheese, olives, cucumber, tomatoes and greens. But next he brought out the masterpiece! The Keto Plate had arrived! It had succulent filet mignon, juicy chicken and the most flavorful beef kabab I have ever tasted! He told me the meats were prepared with grass fed butter and organic ingredients. Two amazing sauces came with my feast; a savory garlic sauce and fresh and cool tzatziki! They were both incredible but I preferred the garlic and my friend preferred the tzatziki. We ate our fill and were absolutely stuffed! I of course packed up the left overs which, lucky me, were plenty enough for my lunch today! To top it all off this gem is dog friendly. My friend brought her beagle puppy too and they hooked us up with a big treat for her complete with rice and meat! Sally the beagle gave four paws up!

I don't like how they charge extra to get half rice/half salad instead of all rice or all salad, the charge seems really pointless.\",\n",
       " 'This place was delicious!! I am a huge fan of Mediterranean and probably one of the best Ive had. \\xa0The Stoner Gyro fries are scrumptious. And \\xa0the sultan platter was top notch. I highly recommend this place.',\n",
       " \"Everything was so fucking delicious! \\xa0I hardly leave reviews but this was beyond tasty from the juicy meats to creamy dipping sauces. The basmati rice was so moist. I highly recommend trying this food whether you share a plate or get your own bc it's so bomb! We even met the chef which adds his Mexican touch to everything so you know it's gonna to be well seasoned! I'm most definitely going to keep going!\",\n",

       " \"Update: the owner (Rok) reached out to me and explained that they did not have their usual burger patties that day, and offered me another jalapeno mushroom burger to try. Instead of 2 small 4oz patties, this one had 1-8oz patty. It was fresh, lightly seasoned, tender, and although it didn't have the juiciness of a traditional American burger (most likely because it was made with less fatty beef), it was still juicy enough. Great burger, and one that you won't feel like you've gained 10 pounds after eating. Ordered with waffle fries, which were slightly crispy and lightly seasoned, as all waffle fries should be. \\xa0Would definitely recommend. Disclaimer: this review is based on their jalepeno burger only, so it's \\xa0not relevant to people who want to come here to get their normal kebab dishes and sides.This burger was one of the worst I've ever had (in my life), based soley on the patties. They were tough, chewy, flavorless, and tasted as if they were frozen, defrosted, then placed on the grill for a minute. A real disappointment as I was hungry for a burger, and even though this restaurant hasn't staked it's success on the quality of their burgers, it's on the menu, and should at least be decent. It was not.\",\n",
       " 'You can taste the quality in their food. I ordered the platter and I must say it is enough food for two to share. I opted for no rice this time. The wait for food is a little long. But, it is cooked to order and super fresh. If you are in a lunch rush, you may want to order ahead. \\xa0I can see myself becoming a regular here. :)',\n",

       " 'Taste: 5/5 however they charge for water, and they made it seem like I had an option of half salad half rice then charged me $2 for it. In the end i spent $36.48 for a cup of water and one sultan platter which seems a bit much for being two dollar signs.',\n",
       " \"This is my first time here and it was delicious!! The service was great! Portion size was great for price!I got the Sultan platter and all meats were delicious and savory and juicy!!! The cilantro sauce with the warm pita bread was by far some of the best pita and sauce I've tried! I can not recommend this place enough! Only thing I would recommend is I went with my sister in law who is vegan she ordered the falafel salad that she enjoyed a lot but felt that they could've done a better job at promoting their vegan options! But they did offer to put a veggie patty into a Gyro for her which was great! All in all five star for sure!!\",\n",

       " \"Looking for the best Greek Salad in Orange County? Start the navigation system towards the direction of Kabab Place and let them do the rest.The long list of killer options for dining in DTSA seems to just keep getting longer and hopefully, there is no stop in sight as it slowly becomes one of the culinary hotbeds in Orange County. A newcomer to the scene is Kebab Place, which is a Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant in Downtown Santa Ana serving their unique brand of Kebab, Gyro, Wraps, and Salads. The service is warm thanks to it being locally owned and operated and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients employed. The only issue can be parking and if you find a meter nearby, just take it and save yourself some headache. I recently stopped in for lunch and ordered the Greek Salad ($10.00) with the addition of Grilled Chicken ($3.00 upcharge) and the meal was prepared to order and out to me within 10 short minutes. This Greek Salad is a monster to be reckoned with - sporting immense chunks of marinated-then-charbroiled-to-perfection Chicken Breast served next to a mound of wicked fresh Mixed Greens, Roma Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Onion, Kalamata Olives, and Feta Cheese tossed in a zippy, yet light homemade special dressing. From the moist, succulent Chicken to the farm fresh produce there was not a single bite I did not truly adore...Well, there was one bite...Watch out for the Olive Pits - I wasn't expecting them and caught one. Painful. Do not recommend. The meal comes served with warm Pita Bread that begs you to dip it in Kebab Place's sublime Tzaziki sauce between bites of that astonishing Greek Salad. This is the mother of all meals for a hot summer day in Santa Ana - or otherwise. Go ahead and bookmark this restaurant now, thanks.\",\n",

Ironically, I could have started here first because it was across the street from the ticket booth. The manager, Rock, was a gracious host and very friendly. Some of the people waiting for their Mediterranean Sampler were grumbling about the wait but when the platters arrived it was clear that pride and attention to detail went into every portion. I had to wait until the second platter came but Rock was so cool I took a selfie with him. My pics show the results and I have to say that chicken kabob is amongst the best I've had.

I do think the food is a bit overpriced for what you get in the end. The chicken is delicious but isn't the best kabob. You get like two pieces of vegetables and a small amount of rice. The rice was what I was most excited for but was my least favorite part. The pita bread that came with the meal did not taste fresh and I'm 100% that it was store bought. Overall I would recommend going to Panini Grill instead of this location. I will say the chef that brought out my food was very kind. The cashier was what ruined my experience .

       " \"Chicken kebab wrap! The staff is so nice and friendly but the food was a-okay. I got the wrap and ate it only 5 minutes after I received it. However, it was incredibly soggy already as the juices from the meat had permeated the wrapping. At the end, I was eating a bite of the wrap with a fork while trying to get pieces of meat and tomato with my hands. Everything was torn up and dripping. It's not necessarily their fault but I've never had this problem with any other wraps. The plates are a lot more filling and come with a lot of food! You would not run into the problem I ran into with the plates, but insofar as I ate the wrap, I have nothing more to say!\",\n",
       " \"Having just moved to Santa Ana recently I just happened across the Kebab Place the other day after what looked like a particularly busy lunch. \\xa0Everything was clean and well designed and the environment was comfortable. \\xa0So having been moving towards being a vegetarian I ordered the falafel salad to go. \\xa0It took just a little longer to get my food than I thought it should but I think they had been so busy for lunch (a good sign right?). \\xa0I took my falafel home and it was fresh and hot and had a wonderful crunch on the outside and tasty inside. \\xa0The sauces provided were fresh and tasty. \\xa0So I decided today to use the online ordering to order a chicken wrap and got it to go again because I live so close and needed to get back to my home office. \\xa0The ordering was super easy and allowed me to pay on-line. \\xa0I walked over and the same friendly man, I'm assuming the owner, greeted me and asked me if I needed anything else and handed me my wrap. \\xa0I got home and opened it up and realized that I hadn't checked the tzatziki check box so there wasn't any included, oops. \\xa0I won't make that mistake again. \\xa0Not that I really needed it because the wrap alone was scrumptious! \\xa0Chicken was moist and flavorful and the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tasty. \\xa0I could make this a regular habit and I'm just really grateful Kebab Place is close by.By the way, I saw a one star review for Kebab Place and can't help but think the reviewer had other motives or was just ignorant regarding what good food and service is. \\xa0I thought the portion size was perfect and the service was friendly and the food was very flavorful. \\xa0Some people just can't be pleased with anything.\",\n",

I had the salmon kebab and I couldn't have been happier. Everything was perfect, from the rice to the succulent pieces of marinated salmon. The salad crisp and substantial with chunks of cucumber and tomatoes. Their chicken kebab is just as succulent. It was a meal worthy of a five star restaurant. All that was missing was a nice glass of wine. They don't have their alcohol license yet, but I understand they are working on it.

There\\'s counter seating along the wall, and 4 or 5 tables for 2 or 4 people along the other wall, and a few tables outside. \\xa0I wasn\\'t too happy you have to crane your neck to read the menu posted above the order counter. \\xa0Yes, its big but it\\'s also 10 feet above you.There\\'s no \"lunch specials\" here, or combos like a chicken and a beef plate, or a soup and salad combo. We decided on the recommended Chicken Kebob. \\xa0My coworker Anna had it with rice only, while I had the rice and salad combo for the same price.While we waited, we received a basket of hot. freshly grilled pita bread. \\xa0We were fortunate that we were the first one there, so our food didn\\'t take long. \\xa0While we were eating, the place got filled up pretty fast.The only difference between my chicken plate and Anna\\'s rice only plate is Anna got an extra tomato and no salad, while I got a bowl of salad but heavy on the vinaigrette dressing. Very tart and sour! \\xa0If you want a salad, ask for the dressing on the side.My chicken plate with a canned soda (only a buck, cheaper than a fountain drink) came to $14 and change after tax. \\xa0I gave $15 and told them to keep the change.Overall, not bad. \\xa0I\\'ve had better Persian/ Middle Eastern food. The chicken had good flavor but a bit dry. \\xa0The portion is adequate for lunch, but for $12, I\\'d rather go to Panini Grill at the MainPlace Mall for more.I\\'d come back if I didn\\'t want to drive my car, as its only 2 blocks from my office.',\n",

Including myself, there were two other patrons, whom were almost done with their meals. Decor was charming and atmosphere laid back. Wait: I waited around 30 minutes for my order (2 gyros and a salad), which I felt was quite a long time for being the only person ordering in the restaurant. \\xa0Food: Mediocre. Gyro was on the saltier side, and the salad had a lot of liquid (I did not put dressing in my salad) at the bottom. Freshly washed lettuce, maybe? Portions were plentiful, which was nice. However, something occurred that made my experience here very negative. As I was waiting I turned to find the gentleman that greeted me VAPING at the register. In the enclosed restaurant space. Literally less than 10 feet away from the restaurant kitchen. That is unacceptable--especially if you are helping to handle food.Even if smoking was allowed in an enclosed restaurant space, the fact that restaurant staff was smoking during business hours (he was not on a work break) and so close to the food prep area was a big NOPE.Overall, food itself was fine, but it is not worth it for me to return upon seeing that disregard of health code.',\n",

Kebab Place I first tried when I went to the YEE Taste Of Santa Ana and got a sample of their Greek Stoner Fries and have been meaning to come back. Well I got the chance and now can say with confidence that this place rocks. A very nice family ran and owned restaurant awaits you here. If you have questions ask them, they will inform you anything you want to know about their food. My wife and I came in and ordered the Greek Stoner Fries and a Chicken Gyro. What I didnt realize was that the portion on the fries was massive and you can easily share with another person and be full. The fries are a perfect crisp and stay that way, while your taste buds dance around the wonderful feta and tzatziki sauce. No shortage of meat on the plate either. If you are here dont pass these up. We had to get the chicken wrap to go as we were just too stuffed to even touch it. Again lesson learned here. But I got into it for dinner later that night and it was good. I am sure it would have been way better if I would have taken it down on the spot and not reheated. Either way this is a great spot that needs more love from the Yelp community. Get here and check this place out my fellow yelpers! CHEERS!!!!',\n",

I am sure there are more good places around. We tried the chicken platter and lamb platter the owner Gita was sweet enough to provide us complimentary chicken barley soup with our orders. Amazing stuff : The chicken was perfectly cooked - soft and flavorful. Hands down best chicken I have had in Santa Ana. Go for a chicken platter and you won't be disappointed. Good Stuff: Pita and house green sauce were good. Really went well with the chicken and rice- cooked nicely. Meh : The Lamb was not impressive. My wife and I both had to spit it out. It was too chewy and just didn't feel right. They really need to rework on it. No hummus! There was no hummus on the side with the platter! The soup was ok- nothing that will draw me back to this place. Ambiance: The restaurant is relatively small in size with 3-4 indoor seating tables and a bar style seating on the other end. They use disposable cutlery and plates which wasn't impressive.\",\n",

Very generous portions.The meats were marinated to perfection. Best chicken I've had. So fresh, that I swear we were eating on a farm! The sauces were tasty. The pita bread was to die for. Rok informed us that it's made on site. I particularly liked that Rok was comfortable explaining what sauces went with the meats and what went with the rice. He's passionate about his food.

       " \"This is for my experience with ordering delivery through Yelp. Here are the reasons why I am giving this place 1 star:1) I placed the order a little after 12 pm for 3 items. food was to be delivered at 1:12 pm, at :1:20 pm I called to get an update and the lady that answers the phone abruptly tells me the driver is on the way. No apologies were given for not having the food delivered on time. I asked when will he arrive? She responded with I don't know m, there's traffic. Great we ordered food for a client and now have to tell him we don't know when his lunch will be here. 2) driver comes a little after 2 pm and I see that there are only 2 boxes, we had ordered 3 items. After inspection I realized they left out a chicken kebab plate. I called the restaurant and the same lady said she can put in another order for the missing item. I'm thinking she must be crazy because it took 2 hours for the food to get here. I said no and told her I wanted my $ back for that missing item and she said to go through Yelp. I went through yelp to get my $ back. 3) I ordered chicken Greek salad and my Greek salad did not come with any dressing. What a terrible experience. I was not given the impression that the restaurant wanted to make things right with me as I have a valid reason to be upset. I'm sitting here writing this email hangry btw.\",\n",

The meals they make are different than what the menu says it's supposed to come with, and claim their meals don't come with hummus anymore and you have to pay extra, even though the menu says it comes with hummus.

       " \"Poor customer service Apparently the menu thru doordash is different than what they have there at the restaurant. When I tried to order in person what I had ordered thru doordash one week prior, he told me their system was different and that he'd have to charge me for two separate kabobs which came out to $5 extra.. so $20 for one plate! The right thing to do from a customer service standpoint would've been to honor that price shown online. Very disappointing. Won't bother going there again.\",\n",

The platter comes with a salad and rice, and my friend got the falafel platter which came with fries (and I love fries).

Also the salad that comes with the plate is a small meal in itself. The gyro was a little different than I expected, but was good. It was thinly sliced on a platter with rice. Portion sizes were good, we ended up taking a plate to go since we weren't that hungry to finish both orders. They don't have the garlic butter as some places do but they have a jalapeño cilantro dip that went great with the bread and even for the rice.

It's almost like a chimichurri, but with a little more bite to it. Really good. Pita bread was hot as fuck too which was appreciated. Appetizer:I had the falafel and wasn't too thrilled about it. It's not your usual ball shape, bite more cone like. I like my falafel crispy and light on the inside. This kinda lacked in both categories for me. Main:I had the chicken kebab. This was delicious and definitely recommended. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was on point and they gave me a boatload of rice. Being Asian there's really never enough rice.

My boyfriend and I ordered the special fillet steak wrap, stoner greek fries, and the combo platter. Every meal comes with complimentary pita bread and a cilantro/jalapeno house sauce (both pita and sauce were pure magick). They also gave us complimentary lentil soup which was very hearty as well as tasty. The fillet mignon in the steak wrap was superior. Marinated, tender, excellent portion. The gyro in the stoner greek fries was perhaps the best gyro I\\'ve had. It wasn\\'t dry and was very well seasoned. The hummus, babaganouj, and tzatziki dips were all perfection. Dolmades were delish.I have nothing bad to say about this place. Customer service was great. Food came out quickly, but not too quickly. By the taste of the food, you can tell everything is fresh and dedication and thoughtfulness is flowing through that kitchen. The price, I considered moderate on it\\'s face.

When it came, it was way less food and didn't get hummus.

He said the sampler platter was mispriced and it was really $14 but that still didn't make sense how it is cheaper for more food. When I tried to clarify he just asked well what can I do for you because I have a line of people. I understand that he probably had other customers but felt rushed and cut off and didn't have a good explanation.

       " 'I don\\'t know what the deal is with this place. I came by because I was on jury duty and it had good reviews here on Yelp. I was supremely disappointed. I gave two stars rather than one ONLY because the employees were friendly.First of all, the place was nearly empty when I got there (I beat the rush), but it still took over 20 minutes to get my food. A rush came in after I sat down; I can\\'t imagine how long they must have been waiting. I did notice that some takeout orders were going out, so maybe that\\'s what slowed them down. Regardless, when you have a limited time for lunch, a 20 minute wait is not great.Secondly, the food was really weird. I ordered a lamb kebab platter. I got a large oval plate with a HUGE amount of rice (seriously, probably 2X or 3X the amount of rice I\\'m used to getting at places like this), maybe 4-5oz of meat, two pieces of grilled tomato, one half of a jalapeño, and 4 triangles of pita. Oh, and about a tablespoon of sauce in a small container. The meat tasted reasonably good (maybe a little over-cooked), the pita was ok, and I liked the sauce. But the proportions of everything were way out of whack. I almost laughed when I saw how much rice there was in comparison to vegetables and meat.I almost never complain about pricing on Yelp because I\\'m happy to pay for good food (and I think people are way too quick to complain that something is \"overpriced\"). But this is unreasonable enough that I can\\'t in good conscience let is pass without mention. For the aforementioned plate of mostly rice with a little bit of meat, plus a fountain soda (more on that in a moment), I paid just over $18. Plus tip - there\\'s a tip line on the receipt, and I would have felt like a jerk leaving it blank, so make it $21.Finally, something was really off with the fountain drink. I ordered Diet Coke, and it tasted nothing like Diet Coke. I\\'m not sure if it was a knockoff brand, or the syrup was expired, or what, but it was NOT Diet Coke. It also had a bit of a \"musty\" taste to it. Maybe just poor quality product, or maybe the equipment wasn\\'t clean? Anyway, I took a few sips and threw it out. I\\'ll also note that the fountain is behind the register, so you can\\'t regulate your own ice/soda ratio or do your own refills (an extremely minor point that wouldn\\'t warrant a mention if it weren\\'t for all the other stuff).Anyway, maybe I came on an off day and ordered the wrong stuff. I don\\'t know what else explains all of the very positive reviews of this place. Believe it or not, I\\'m a pretty positive person, I like most of the places I eat, and I only leave negative reviews on Yelp if I think it\\'s important. In this case, my experience was bad enough, and the other reviews so out of sync with it, that I feel I HAVE to add some balance.One other probably irrelevant point I should mention. Last time I was on jury duty, about two years ago, I had an eerily similar experience at a different restaurant in this EXACT SAME location. It was a burger place, it had a bunch of really positive reviews, the wait was long, and the food mediocre. Maybe this location is cursed? Maybe I am? I don\\'t know. All I can say is that next time I have jury duty, I will not eat at whatever restaurant happens to be occupying this storefront. There are plenty of other good places to eat near by.',\n",

       " 'Very delicous food. Great location, and very hospitable personnel. Definitely recommend the lamb.',\n",

       " \"Saw this place when browsing through Yelp, so glad I decided to look into it. I was being lazy and decided to use the advertised Eat24 ordering they had set up and got the chicken kebab dish for take out. When I went to pick it up, there was minimal wait time as it was being fresh made and I was offered to join their rewards program for a free lentil soup. The lentil soup is a must try! It is absolutely delicious! Besides that, the customer service is incredible. Everyone working there is happy to help you and give the best recommendations. They are very friendly and will help you with any questions you may have. Now the chicken kebab, it was delicious as well and came with several sauces and fresh baked pita bread. Only issue, chicken started to taste a bit dry but I have a feeling that's because I didn't eat it until after I walked home with it. If you have it fresh in the store, you won't be disappointed. It's listed as a must try and it really is a must try dish. I highly recommend this place for delicious fresh made dishes to satisfy many cravings and make sure you try their lentil soup!\",\n",
       " \"Just had a great lunch! The gyro was very meaty with great spices. Hummus was really good too. They serve it with a really lovely green herb tapenade that was a little spicy but added an interesting piquant to the flavors. There is a new owner and he was very gracious. He brought out some really great Lebanese baklava. It was very moist and not too sweet. I'll come again!\",\n",

       " \"I ate here for lunch today. It was quick and convenient. I ordered the gyro wrap, and it was huge. Thankfully, I did not get fries because I couldn't finish the entire wrap. It was tasty and had plenty of sauce (no need to order extra like I did). I would go back.\",\n",
       " \"The ABSOLUTE BEST Gyro I have ever had and their signature sauce is just delicious (wish they would sell in big jars to buy and take home). \\xa0I want to try other items but just can't get pass the gyro... so, so, so good! \\xa0I drive from Costa Mesa just to have one.... I need to remember they are not open on Sunday....\",\n",
       " \"I've only tried the stoner greek fries so far, but they were great...huge portion with a load of gyro meat. \\xa0I was getting over the craziness of Crave at lunch time and this was a great option. \\xa0Fresh food.

The chicken kabab plate is one of my favorite options- seriously the best seasoned, perfectly cooked chicken I've ever had. \\xa0I also love their hot pita bread and tzatziki sauce appetizer. \\xa0The owner is so friendly and kind as well. \\xa0Every co-worker I've brought has become addicted (this makes the wait a little longer during the business crows rush but so worth it =)\",\n",
       " \"Best kabob in town. If you go you have to try the lamb kabob, it's a must try. No other restaurant compares. The competition is lacking. If I could I would give kebab place 12 stars.\",\n",
       " \"I've been coming here since it opened and is close to all the government buildings and courts in DTSA. I like the grilled chicken and gyros. The plates come with rice but they will do half rice/salad or all salad if you prefer. Customer service is always good. Wait time can be long if they are busy. Best to phone in to go orders.\",\n",
       " \"The food is absolutely, incredibly delicious. The next Mediterranean food in the OC, even trumps my fav, Caspian. The meat, beef, lamb or chicken is cooked to perfection; tender and juicy. \\xa0The staff is nice and their service is very good even during the lunch rush. Too bad it doesn't stay open later than 7 pm.\",\n",
       " 'The gyro wrap is my absolute favorite, but the chicken kabob is a close second. \\xa0Everything is very fresh and the pita bread is the best. \\xa0An easy, quick place to grab a healthy lunch in DTSA. The seasoned fries are great too!',\n",

       " \"I was in the downtown area and decided to grab some lunch. I've been craving falafel's, and saw this place. I decided to give them a try. I got the felafel wrap. It is really delicious. The falafel tastes homemade,has lots of flavor, is nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. \\xa0It's one of the better falafel's I've had before. The place is quaint and seems clean. Always a good thing. The parking is all paid in this area, but there is a garage around the corner. I think these are going to be a new craving for me. :-P\",\n",

      "Came here based off yelp reviews. This place did not disappoint, everything was wonderful!!! I'm so full right now shared the Sultan platter with my wife and we also had the sampler appetizer. The humus - tzatziki - babaganoush were all outstanding along with their cilantro citrus dip = Great combination. On the platter we had Chicken, Steak, Lamb kabobs all three were cooked perfect and the flavor was the best I've had.(Did I mention I'm stuffed!!) oh yeah and falafel was on point! Without a doubt top Mediterranean place I've been too, don't live near hear but I will definitely be making the 1/2 hour trek to eat here again. Staff were extremely friendly and inviting as well as helpful in menu selection. Bistro style inside, quaint and comfortable. We will be back, got a lot more menu to try!\n"
